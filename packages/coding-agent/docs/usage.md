# Use Pi in the terminal

Run `pi` from the folder you want to work in. Pi uses that folder to discover files, instructions, and configuration, and to group saved sessions. If you have not installed Pi or chosen a model yet, follow the [Quickstart](quickstart.md).

Pi may ask whether you trust the working folder before loading its project resources. See [Project trust](security.md#understand-project-trust).

The transcript shows your prompts, Pi's responses, tool calls, results, and errors. You write prompts and commands in the editor. The footer shows the current folder, session, model, context usage, and accumulated usage and cost.

## Enter a prompt

Type a request and press `Enter` to send it. Use `Shift+Enter` to add a line, or press `Ctrl+G` to work on a longer prompt in your configured external editor.

To include files or images:

- Type `@` to search for a file and add it to your prompt.
- Press `Tab` to complete a path.
- Paste an image or drag it into a compatible terminal.

## Follow Pi's work

Pi starts in **prose-only mode** by default. Set `"proseOnly": false` in [settings.json](settings.md#terminal-and-display) and restart Pi to start in the normal view instead.

Prose-only mode lets you keep your messages and assistant text, but hide thinking (including its placeholder) and tool details, including codemode scripts, nested calls, results, and tool images—even when a tool fails. Failed tools show a compact notice with a shortcut hint to leave prose mode and inspect the details, except `WaitForBash` and `codemode`, which stay completely hidden even on failure. Warnings, approval dialogs, and commands you run with `!` remain visible. The built-in footer shows `prose only` while enabled.

Press `Alt+O` to switch between prose-only mode and the normal view, restoring its previous collapse states even during a running tool. In the normal view, `Ctrl+O` expands or collapses tool output and `Ctrl+T` shows or hides thinking blocks. In prose mode the working indicator above the input shows tool-call count, elapsed time, and failed calls when nonzero (for example, `Working · 14 tool calls · 1m 23s`). Counts include codemode and its nested calls, accumulate across retries and compaction, and reset for the next request after the agent settles. A failed call does not necessarily mean the task failed.

The shortcut is a display-only toggle for the current Pi process and does not save the startup setting; it does not change reasoning effort, model context, saved history, or exports. On macOS, the terminal must send Option as Alt. Rebind `app.transcript.prose` in [Keybindings](keybindings.md) if needed.

The startup header lists the instructions and resources Pi loaded. The editor border indicates the current thinking level. The footer updates as the model uses context and reports usage.

Pi does not ask before every tool call. Review commands and changed files, and use a sandbox for untrusted or unattended work. See [Security](security.md).

## Change direction

You can send more input while Pi is working:

| What you want | Action |
|---|---|
| Adjust the current task | Type a message and press `Enter` |
| Add work after the current task | Type a message and press `Alt+Enter` |
| Return queued messages to the editor | Press `Alt+Up` |
| Stop the current task | Press `Escape` |

A message sent with `Enter` waits until the current response and its tool calls finish, then guides the next response. A follow-up sent with `Alt+Enter` waits until Pi finishes the current task. Aborting returns queued messages to the editor.

Windows Terminal reserves some Alt shortcuts. See [Terminal Setup](terminal-setup.md) for the Windows alternatives.

## Change the model or settings

Type `/` to search the available commands. The commands you will use most often are:

- `/model` selects a model. Press `Ctrl+L` to open the same selector.
- `/thinking` selects how much reasoning the current model uses. Press `Shift+Tab` to cycle through supported levels.
- `/login` and `/logout` manage provider access.
- `/settings` changes common preferences.

Prompt templates, skills, and extensions can add more commands to the same menu. See [Choose a Model](models.md), [Configuration](configuration.md), or the complete [Slash Commands reference](slash-commands.md).

## Continue or start over

Pi saves sessions automatically unless session persistence is disabled.

- `/new` starts a new session.
- `/resume` opens another saved session.
- `/name` gives the current session a recognizable name.
- `/session` shows its file, ID, message count, token usage, and cost.

Use `/tree`, `/fork`, or `/clone` when you want to explore another approach without losing existing work. Use `/compact` to reduce the conversation history sent to the model. See [Sessions and Context](sessions.md) for these workflows.

After leaving Pi, run `pi --continue` from the same folder to resume its most recent session.

## Run a terminal command

Prefix a command with `!` to run it and include its output in the conversation:

```text
!git status
```

Use `!!` when you want to run a command without sending its output to the model.

## Copy, export, or share results

Press `Ctrl+X` or run `/copy` to copy the last assistant response. Use `/export` to save the session as HTML or JSONL.

Use `/share` to upload the session and get a viewer link. By default, Radius authentication makes the artifact visible to your Radius organization; otherwise, Pi creates a private GitHub gist through the GitHub CLI. The [`sessionShareDestination`](settings.md#sessions-and-context) setting can force either destination. Review the session first because it can contain prompts, tool output, file contents, and credentials exposed during the conversation.

## Adjust the terminal

Fullscreen mode, the default, keeps the editor and status area fixed while the transcript scrolls within the terminal window. Regular mode uses the terminal's normal scrollback. Choose a mode through `/settings` or `--tui-mode`.

Terminal support for mouse input, keyboard shortcuts, and inline images varies. See [Terminal Setup](terminal-setup.md) for platform-specific configuration and [Keybindings](keybindings.md) for every configurable shortcut. Run `/hotkeys` to inspect the shortcuts active in your current session.

## Collect diagnostic information

When troubleshooting terminal rendering or conversation state, run `/debug`. Pi writes the rendered terminal lines and current session messages to `pi-debug.log` in your [agent directory](configuration.md#agent-directory).

Review this file before sharing it. It can contain prompts, model responses, tool output, file contents, and terminal data.
