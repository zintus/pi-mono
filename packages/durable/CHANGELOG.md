# Changelog

## [1.0.4] - 2026-10-05

### Breaking Changes

- `NodeExecutionEnv.watch()` fails with `permission_denied` when a target, or a watched directory itself, cannot be read for lack of permission; before, it was watched as if missing. Later rescans that hit this report `{ error }` with `permission_denied` instead of `invalid`.
- The env conformance suite checks three more `watch()` behaviors: changes to the file a watched symbolic link points to, recursive coverage below a target that a non-recursive target overlaps, and a directory replaced at the same path. Custom environments that passed the 1.0.3 suite may need changes.

### Added

- `createPowerShellTool()` in `@earendil-works/pi-durable/tools`: a `powershell` tool that runs `pwsh`, else Windows PowerShell, directly through argv `exec` (no other shell parses the command), with UTF-8 output and the `bash` tool's output window, spill and errors.

### Fixed

- The `read` tool reads a file that grows while it is read (an active log) instead of failing with "changed while it was read"; it reads again only when the file shrank or was rewritten in place.
- `NodeExecutionEnv.watch()`: a directory replaced at the same path gets a new native watcher; a target that is a symbolic link to a file reports changes to that file; a non-recursive target no longer stops an overlapping recursive target from covering subdirectories; closing during a rescan no longer leaks watchers.
- Bounded tool output keeps a U+FEFF at the start of the retained tail, and drops a byte-order mark only at the very start of byte output.
- `settings.progress` fields given as `undefined` keep their defaults.

## [1.0.3] - 2026-10-05

### Breaking Changes

- `FileSystem` requires `openBinaryReader()` and `openDirReader()`; custom environments must implement them.
- `BinaryReader` requires `scanLines()`.
- `FileSystem` requires `watch()`.
- `Shell.exec()` accepts an argv array besides a shell string, and `ShellExecOptions.onOutput` receives a third `info` argument naming the stream (`stdout` or `stderr`); custom environments must accept both forms and pass the stream.

### Added

- `openBinaryReader()` for bounded positional reads of one opened regular file, with `noFollow` to refuse a final-component symlink.
- `openDirReader()` for paged directory listings that read metadata only for returned entries.
- Argv form of `exec()`, which runs a program without a shell.
- `createEnvConformance()` and `registerEnvConformance()` in `@earendil-works/pi-durable/testing` for checking custom `ExecutionEnv` implementations.
- `settings.progress` with `partialIntervalMs` and `outputIntervalMs` configures how often generation partials and running tool output are committed; defaults stay 100 ms ([#10357](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/10357))
- `ShellExecOptions.window` and `ShellOutputInfo.skipped`: an environment may omit shell output outside the caller's retained tail and report the omission, so remote environments need not transfer output the caller drops. `ToolExecutionApi.outputWindow` provides the window and `output(chunk, skipped)` counts omissions; the `bash` tool passes them through.
- `BinaryReader.scanLines()` locates and measures a span of lines in one pass inside the environment; `LineScanner`, `StreamDecoder`, `rangeDecoder()` and `startsWithBom()` in `@earendil-works/pi-durable/env` let other environments decode and scan exactly like `NodeExecutionEnv`.
- `FileSystem.watch()` reports changes to files and directories, recursive with excludes, including missing targets, with explicit `overflow` and `error` and a `native` or `polling` mode. `NodeExecutionEnv` polls on Windows (native watchers there keep directories open, which blocks renaming their parents) and on network and FUSE file systems, and on macOS rescans shortly after installing native watchers because FSEvents misses changes made right after `fs.watch` returns; its `watch` option sets the mode, poll interval, and directory limit.

### Changed

- The `read` tool reads only the file's header, one scan, and the lines it shows, instead of loading the whole file; its results are unchanged.

### Fixed

- `NodeExecutionEnv.flushFile()` on a directory fails with `is_directory` on Windows, as on POSIX.
- Tail-retained tool output no longer depends on when progress commits happened: a progress snapshot compacted the stored output to the kept window, which could move where a later window's first line started.
- `NodeExecutionEnv` shell output and text line readers no longer drop a U+FEFF that follows a chunk boundary; Node's streaming `TextDecoder` with BOM handling dropped it, unlike decoding all of the bytes at once.

## [1.0.2] - 2026-10-04

### Fixed

- Persisted a distinct provider session UUID per conversation and forwarded it for prompt-cache and session affinity ([#10424](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/10424))

## [1.0.1] - 2026-10-03

## [1.0.0] - 2026-10-01

### Added

- Initial release of `@earendil-works/pi-durable`, a durable agent harness. See the [README](README.md) and the [design document](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/blob/main/packages/durable/docs/spec.md).
