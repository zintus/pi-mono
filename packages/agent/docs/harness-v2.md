# Durable AgentHarness design

> **Compatibility policy.** Old coding-agent v3 JSONL sessions must open and restore idle. This is the only backward-compatibility requirement. All other formats and APIs in `packages/agent/src/harness` and `packages/session-backends/sqlite-node` (and their respective tests) may break. We do not write migrations, schema versioning, or conversion paths for anything else.

The harness executes runs against one session. The session holds four kinds of state (section 2). Lanes execute in parallel inside one harness (section 3). Storage backends encode the session (Part III).

# Part I — Concepts

## 1. Goals

- **Durable runs.** An accepted prompt is a durable operation. After a crash, a new process restores the session. It resumes the run from the last safe boundary. Every state that a crash can produce is recoverable.
- **Lanes.** A session hosts one or more lanes. A lane is a named position in the conversation tree. Each lane runs at most one operation at a time. Lanes run in parallel. A run and its queued messages belong to the lane that accepted them. Example: a Slack channel is a session; each thread is a lane. Interactive pi uses one lane and does not show the concept in its UI. Extensions get the full harness API, including lanes. Example: a subagent tool runs on a second lane of its parent's session.
- **No partial outcomes.** A crash inside any operation — run, compaction, navigation — leaves one of two states: the operation has not happened, or recovery can complete it. Nothing in between is observable.
- **Harness API.** Events observe execution and cannot change it. Hooks intercept execution and can change it: context, requests, tools, run boundaries. Extensions build on events and hooks.
- **Deterministic stepping.** Every effect — durable write, provider request, tool execution, hook, timer — crosses one injected boundary. In `drive: "manual"` the harness parks before each effect and a test drives it call by call: stop at any boundary, inject input, or close and reopen to simulate a crash. Production and tests run the same procedures; the drive mode only controls the boundary (section 15).
- **Observability.** All execution is instrumentable for logging and tracing, down to provider request and response internals. This channel is separate from the hook system.
- **UI model.** A client gets one atomic snapshot, then a live event stream. Events are not replayed. Reconnect means a new snapshot.
- **Single writer.** One harness writes a session at a time. The serving layer enforces this. All lanes of a session live in that one harness. Restore treats states that a single writer cannot produce as corruption.
- **v3 sessions load.** Old coding-agent v3 JSONL files open unchanged and restore idle.

## Non-goals

- **Exactly-once hook side effects.** A hook result becomes durable when the record or entry that consumes it commits. A crash before that commit can run the hook again (section 11 replay table). Side effects a hook makes on its own are invisible to the harness: HTTP calls, file writes. A hook that needs crash-safe external effects must be idempotent, for example keyed by operation id.
- **Provider stream resumption.** Partial streams are never persisted. An interrupted streaming request is retried or abandoned. Deferred requests are different and in scope: the provider returns a handle at once and serves the result later (e.g. `background: true` on a Responses API, batch APIs). pi-ai returns an assistant message with stop reason `deferred` that carries the handle; it is persisted like any assistant message. Redeeming the handle appends a normal assistant message. Recovery sees the unredeemed handle and fetches instead of paying for a new request.
- **Multiple writers.** Two processes on one session are out of scope. The serving layer routes all traffic for a session to the process that holds its harness. Lanes cover the workloads that look like multi-writer: parallel threads over shared history.
- **Replication.** A session lives in one place. Coordination-free sync of diverging copies is a different design. Nothing forecloses it later.
- **Coding-agent migration.** Migrating coding-agent to `AgentHarness` is out of scope. Compatibility means the new JSONL repository can read supported coding-agent v3 files.

## 2. What a session is

A session is durable state with four parts:

1. **The tree** — the conversation. Entries with `parentId` links: messages, model/thinking/tool-activation changes, compaction summaries, branch summaries, custom entries. The tree is shared and passive. It belongs to no lane. It only grows; entries are never changed or deleted.
2. **Lanes** — where work happens. A lane is a name plus a leaf: the entry that future work extends. Every session has the lane `main`. Applications create more, keyed by external identity (a Slack thread id, an email thread id).
3. **Lane operation logs** — what happened and what must happen. One flat, chronological record sequence per lane: operation started, step attempted, tool started, message queued, operation finished. This is where durability is implemented: records exist so that a new process can continue a lane's work after a crash. Nothing reads them during normal execution.
4. **Global facts** — session-scoped values where the latest write wins: the session name, entry labels. Not part of the tree. Kept as append-only history; readers see the newest value.

All writes across the four parts share one monotonic sequence number. The sequence orders global-fact history and lets a lane's operation log refer to tree positions.

```text
tree (shared, append-only)          lanes
a ── b ── c ── d                    main            → d   (op log: …)
      └── e ── f                    slack:171943…   → f   (op log: …)

global facts: name = "Refactor auth", label(b) = "checkpoint-1"
```

### Active and passive

The tree and the global facts are passive: shared data, readable by anything.

A lane is active. It owns its leaf, its operation log (at most one open operation), its queues, and its pending writes. Two lanes never share any of these. Every action of a lane produces entries chained to its leaf, or records in its own operation log.

### Invariants

- The tree is conversation only. No lane state, no orchestration state, no pointers live in it.
- An entry's parent chain never changes. Branches share prefixes; nothing is copied.
- A lane's leaf moves in exactly two ways: the lane appends an entry (leaf becomes that entry), or the lane navigates (leaf jumps to an existing entry).
- Operation-log records never affect the tree. Deleting every operation log leaves a complete, valid conversation.
- At most one operation is open per lane. A state where one lane has two open operations is corruption.
- Entries are shared; records are not. Two lanes may have the same entry on their paths. A record belongs to exactly one lane.

Records are not tree entries because they describe execution, not conversation: they must never enter model context, transcripts, branch queries, or forks, and within one lane their order is already their meaning — parent links would add nothing.

## 3. Lanes

A lane is a named position in the tree plus the work serialized on it. The closest existing concept is a git branch checked out in its own worktree: a name attached to a position, advanced by new work, movable to any entry without rewriting history, and never checked out twice. One difference to git intuition: navigation moves a lane to any entry, not only forward.

Every session has the lane `main`. Applications create further lanes with a name and an anchor entry. Lane names are permanent application keys: a Slack thread id, an email thread id. No UI lists lanes in the abstract; the platform's own UI (the thread list) plays that role.

A lane owns:

- **Its leaf.** New entries chain to it and move it. Navigation jumps it.
- **Its operation log.** At most one open operation. A second operation on a busy lane is rejected; other lanes are unaffected.
- **Its queues.** Steering, follow-ups, and next-run messages target one lane.
- **Its configuration view.** Model, thinking level, and active tools are entries on the path behind the lane's leaf. Two lanes can run different models without knowing of each other. Tool implementations, resources, and stream options are harness-global; only their activation is per-lane.

Rules:

- Lanes run operations in parallel. The harness stays the single writer; lane records and entries interleave in the shared sequence.
- Creating a lane copies nothing. Lanes are not deleted or renamed.
- State-dependent mutations on one lane are linearized on that lane's mutation line: validation, at most one durable write, and the in-memory update complete before the next mutation starts (section 15). Provider, tool, hook, and retry work never occupies the mutation line.
- Two lanes at the same leaf diverge on their next append. The tree handles this; no coordination exists between lanes.
- A lane with an unfinished operation restores as suspended, independently of its siblings. Suspension has a reason: crash, or a deferred provider request (section 1).

## 4. How work executes

### Operations

An operation is the unit of durable work on a lane. Three kinds:

- **Run** — an accepted prompt, through all automatic continuations: tool calls, steering, follow-ups, auto-compaction. Ends when nothing is pending.
- **Compaction** — replaces old context with a summary entry.
- **Navigation** — moves the lane's leaf to an existing entry, optionally with a branch summary.

An operation is accepted before it executes. Acceptance is durable: after a crash, an accepted operation is either completed by recovery or explicitly closed. Every accepted run ends `completed`, `failed`, or `aborted` (stopped by abort). Compaction and navigation may additionally end `declined` when their decision hook vetoes the accepted structural operation before its effect.

### Runs, turns, and steps

A run is a sequence of turns. A turn is one assistant step plus the complete tool batch requested by that assistant message.

A step is a retryable unit of work inside an operation: produce an assistant message, a compaction summary, or a branch summary. A step may make zero, one, or several provider requests. A failed attempt retries the same step; the attempt count is durable and survives restarts. A deferred provider request ends an assistant step: the handle arrives inside a persisted assistant message that closes the step, the operation suspends, and redemption later appends the real result (section 1).

Each tool call that starts an effect is also a step. `tool_started` opens it; its tool-result entry closes it. A parallel batch holds several open tool steps at once; their effects run concurrently and finalize in source order (section 14).

### Queues and deferred writes

Two mechanisms carry input into a running lane. They differ in abort behavior:

- **Queues** carry conversational intent: `steer` corrects the current work, `followUp` adds work for when the model would stop, `nextRun` seeds the lane's next run. Steering and follow-ups die on abort; their payloads are returned to the caller. Next-run messages survive.
- **Deferred writes** carry facts: entries and configuration changes requested while a step is in flight. They survive abort and are applied even during cancellation.

Both are durable at acceptance: the accepting call writes a record with the full payload to the lane's operation log, then resolves. The tree entry is written later, when the item is applied or consumed — the position where the model first sees it. If the process dies between acceptance and the tree write, recovery reads the record and performs the append. Accepted input is never lost.

### Checkpoints

Between turns, the lane passes a checkpoint:

1. Apply pending deferred writes.
2. Consume queued steering messages.
3. Compact if the next request would not fit.

Compaction has a reactive trigger too: a provider response that reveals the request did not fit — an overflow-form error, or a `length` stop below the intended output cap. That response is discarded and the run compacts and retries once (section 6, "Context overflow at an assistant step").

A turn with tool calls forces another turn so the model sees its results — with one exception: a batch in which every finalized tool result persisted `terminate: true` suppresses automatic tool continuation (steering or follow-up input can still start another turn). Follow-up messages are consumed only when tool continuation and steering are exhausted. The run ends when a checkpoint finds nothing pending.

### Append-only context

> Across the requests of a lane, provider context only grows at the tail. An insertion before the previous request's tail invalidates the provider's KV cache from that point on and multiplies token cost.

This invariant is why mid-turn writes defer to checkpoints: checkpoint application appends at the tail. Compaction is the one deliberate exception; it trades one full cache invalidation for a smaller context.

### Lane lifecycle

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Idle: restored, no open operation
    [*] --> Suspended: restored, open operation
    Idle --> Running: operation accepted
    Running --> Idle: finished
    Running --> Cancelling: abort
    Cancelling --> Idle: reconciled
    Running --> Suspended: deferred handle persisted
    Suspended --> Running: resume continues the open operation
    Suspended --> Cancelling: abort
```

- States are per lane. One exception: a failed storage write faults the whole harness. A faulted harness stops all effects and rejects all calls; after the cause is fixed, reopening restores each lane from its records.
- **Suspended** means: an operation is open, nothing executes. Reached by restore after a crash, or deliberately when a deferred handle is persisted. `resume()` continues the operation; `abort()` closes it without further execution.
- **Abort** records the cancellation durably, signals running effects, and returns. Reconciliation follows: unresolved tool calls get synthetic results, and the transcript gets a closing assistant message. Automatic drive runs it in the background; manual drive leaves it parked at its next action.

### Resume

Resume continues the open operation. It never starts a new one. The entry point is wherever the records end: retry an unfinished step, redeem a deferred handle, reconcile a half-finished tool batch, or continue at the next checkpoint. Queued messages and deferred writes accepted before the crash are still pending and apply normally.

# Part II — How execution is recorded

Part II is backend-neutral. It defines the records a lane writes, when it writes them, and how recovery reads them back. Part III maps this onto APIs and storage.

## 5. Records

### The durability rule

> Before an effect: write an intent record that names what will happen and the ids it will produce. After the effect: append the result as an entry with exactly those ids.

There is no multi-record atomicity and none is needed. Each record and each entry is durable alone. A crash between intent and result leaves the intent unfulfilled; recovery decides per intent type: complete it, retry it, or close it with a synthetic result. An intent is fulfilled if and only if an entry with its provisioned id exists. The entry can itself name the next durable state: an assistant entry with `stopReason: "deferred"` fulfills its attempt's provisioned append and closes the step; what stays outstanding is the operation — the persisted handle awaits redemption (section 6). A provisioned id that exists with different content is corruption.

### Provisioned ids

Intent records carry the ids of entries that do not exist yet:

```ts
/** An entry payload with its id pre-allocated. parentId, seq, and timestamp
    are assigned by storage when the entry is appended: it chains to the
    lane's then-current leaf. */
type ProvisionedEntry<T extends Entry = Entry> =
  T extends Entry ? Omit<T, "parentId" | "seq" | "timestamp"> : never;
```

### Record catalog

Every record belongs to one lane's operation log. Records that belong to an operation carry `runId`: the id of that operation's `operation_started` record. Next-run queue records (`queue_enqueued` and their `queue_cancelled`) and standalone `adjustment` usage records carry no `runId`.

```ts
interface RecordBase {
  id: string;
  seq: number;            // shared sequence, section 2
  lane: string;
  timestamp: number;      // Unix ms
}

// is persisted here. This record's own id IS the runId that all other

```

Blocked or invalid tool calls write no `tool_started`. No effect starts, so no intent is needed: the block is durable as a tool-result entry with `isError: true` and the block reason as content. A crash before that entry loses only the decision, and recovery makes it again — `before_tool` runs again for a call with no `tool_started` and no result.

A tool step needs no outcome record. Its result entry is the complete durable outcome, including the batch-control decision: the tool-result entry persists `terminate` (section 12). A crash after execution but before the result entry follows the replay policy (section 6); re-finalization runs `after_tool` again, which the section 1 non-goal explicitly permits.

Cost is the one concern where an outcome record exists: **cost durability must not depend on result durability**. Retryable steps are precisely the steps designed to produce responses that never become entries — failed attempts, exhausted series, discarded overflow responses — and their spend must not vanish with them. Every provider request therefore settles with a `usage` record before any classification, retry decision, or discard; tool-reported and hook-reported usage get records beside their entries; applications append `adjustment` records for anything the harness cannot see.

A harness-written `usage` record always binds `entryId` to the provisioned id of the entry its measurement belongs to; whether that entry exists is a separate question — a failed attempt's or a discarded response's id never materializes, which is the point. Three layers separate cleanly: an entry's `usage` field is an **immutable snapshot** of the response(s) that produced that entry, written once at append and never touched again; the **effective cost of an entry** is a read-time query — the sum of all lanes' `usage` records bound to its id, base plus adjustments; the **session's cost** is the sum of all `usage` records. Recovery can honestly bill twice — a retried step or a replayed tool writes one record per execution — and the entry snapshot equals the newest non-adjustment record(s) of its id (for compaction and branch summaries: the successful attempt's).

### Validity

Recovery rejects a lane's log as corrupt when:

- more than one operation is open;
- a record references an operation that does not exist, or follows its finish;
- attempt numbers are not consecutive within a step;
- `compactionReason` is absent from a compaction attempt or present on another step kind;
- a steer or follow-up `queue_enqueued` for a run follows its `abort_requested`;
- a `queue_cancelled` targets an id with no `queue_enqueued`, or one whose entry exists;
- attempts in one structural step disagree on `resultEntryId`, or any attempts of one step disagree on `compactionReason`;
- `tool_started.toolIndex` does not identify the stored `toolCallId` and `toolName` in its original assistant entry;
- two `tool_started` records share an invocation identity;
- a provisioned id exists with different content.

## 6. What each action writes

Traces at the storage level. All traces show one lane. Legend:

```text
E   entry appended to the tree (chained to the lane's leaf)
R   record appended to the lane's operation log
L   lane pointer move
G   global fact written
H   hook (awaited; hooks are Part I concepts, their API is Part III)
X   crash site
```

### Run with one tool call

```text
    prompt("fix the bug")
H   before_run                        may inject entries, override system prompt
R   operation_started                 kind run; initial messages with provisioned ids
E   user message                      the provisioned id from the intent
R   step_attempt                      step assistant, attempt 1
E   assistant message [tool call]
H   before_tool                       may change args or block
R   tool_started                      effective args, provisioned result id, replay
H   after_tool                        may patch result and terminate
E   tool result                       the provisioned result id; persists the terminate decision
R   step_attempt                      next turn's assistant step, attempt 1
E   assistant message "done"
H   before_run_end                    nothing pending, returns nothing
R   operation_finished                completed
```

A crash between any two lines is recoverable. The general rule: an intent without its result entry is completed, retried, or closed with a synthetic result by recovery; a result entry without a consumed intent cannot exist.

### Retry

```text
R   step_attempt                      attempt 1
    request fails
R   usage                             the failed attempt's cost — never lost
R   step_attempt                      attempt 2 — durable count
R   usage
E   assistant message
```

Every provider request settles with a `usage` record (section 5); the other traces omit them for brevity. Per-request hooks (`transform_context`, `before_request`, `after_response`) run inside every request and are omitted everywhere; Tier B records them (section 19).

Crash during backoff: restore counts two attempts; resume starts attempt 3. The count never resets. Retryable errors below the cap are never appended as entries. Attempts exhausted — or a non-retryable terminal error — appends an assistant message with the error, then `operation_finished` failed:

```text
E   assistant message                 stop reason error; the failure is durable
X   crash                             operation still open
R   operation_finished                recovery writes failed — never completed
```

The error entry is the terminal-failure marker. Recovery that finds it drains accepted writes and queued input; unless consumed steering or follow-up input starts new work, it closes the run failed (section 7). A run whose newest own message is a step-produced error can never be completed by recovery.

### Context overflow at an assistant step

`length` is ambiguous: generation stopped at some output boundary, but that boundary is either the intended output limit — compaction cannot help — or a smaller context or provider limit, where it can. The classification compares actual output usage (reasoning tokens included) against the **intended** output cap:

```ts
function isRecoverableLength(message: AssistantMessage, desiredMaxOutput: number): boolean {
  if (message.stopReason !== "length") return false;
  // Reaching the caller's or model's intended cap is a genuine output-limit stop.
  if (desiredMaxOutput > 0 && message.usage.output >= desiredMaxOutput) return false;
  // Stopped below the intended cap: context pressure or provider-side truncation.
  return true;
}
```

`desiredMaxOutput` is the caller-supplied `maxTokens` when set, else `model.maxTokens` — the intended limit **before** any context clamping. The value actually sent can never be the reference: some providers reject an explicit output cap outright (the OpenAI Codex backend returns HTTP 400 for `max_output_tokens`), and Pi clamps others to the remaining context. This covers a context-clamped request that returns 16 reasoning tokens against a 128k intent (recover), a Xiaomi/Qwen-style `length` with zero output (recover), and an explicit 1,024 cap fully used (genuine stop) — with no context-percentage heuristics. Overflow-form errors — a provider rejection matching the overflow patterns, or a silent success whose prompt exceeds the window — classify the same way and take the same path.

A recoverable response is **discarded**: like a retryable error, it never becomes an entry, so nothing has to be scrubbed from context on retry, live or after a crash. Its provisioned result id stays unfulfilled; its cost is already durable in the `usage` record written when the request settled (section 5).

```text
R   step_attempt                      step assistant, attempt 1
    response: recoverable             length below the intended cap, or overflow-form error
R   usage                             the discarded response's cost — never lost
    nothing else appended             the response itself is discarded
H   before_compaction                 reason overflow
R   step_attempt                      step compaction, attempt 1
E   compaction entry
R   step_attempt                      step assistant, attempt 1 — new step
E   assistant message
```

**One recovery per conversational input.** An overflow compaction may start only when no overflow-reason compaction `step_attempt` is newer than this run's newest consumed conversational message (prompt, steering, or follow-up). A second recoverable response inside that window appends the give-up error entry and fails the run through the drain path — a `length` response never resets the guard; only consumed conversational input does. This bounds the compact-and-retry loop at one attempt per user action. A `before_compaction` decline or an empty compaction preparation for reason `overflow` is equally terminal: without compaction the request cannot fit. A hook-supplied overflow compaction writes its compaction `step_attempt` before the entry so the guard counts it — the one hook-supplied summary that writes an attempt record.

Per crash site:

| crash after | durable state | recovery |
|---|---|---|
| `step_attempt` (assistant) | unfinished assistant step | resume retries; a recoverable response classifies again live |
| `step_attempt` (compaction, overflow) | unfinished compaction step | resume the compaction step with the recorded reason |
| compaction entry | step closed by its entry | checkpoint path; a fresh assistant step follows |

A genuine `length` stop — output at the intended cap — is appended and handled as before: with tool calls, the truncated batch fails every call without executing; without, the run proceeds to its normal finish. User-facing wording for any truncated response stays neutral ("response was truncated before completion") rather than claiming the configured output limit was reached.

### Steering while a tool runs

```text
E   assistant message [tool call]
R   tool_started
    steer("focus on the tests")       caller resolves here
R   queue_enqueued                    steer, full payload, provisioned id
E   tool result
E   user message                      checkpoint consumes the queue item; provisioned id
R   step_attempt                      next request sees the steering message
```

Crash before `queue_enqueued`: the steer never happened; the caller's promise never resolved. Crash after: recovery finds the record without its entry and appends it at the same point the checkpoint would have.

A queued item can be durably retracted before consumption:

```text
R   queue_enqueued                    steer, full payload, provisioned id
    cancelQueued(entryId)             caller resolves here
R   queue_cancelled                   the entry will never be appended
```

Crash between the two records: the item is still pending; the cancel promise never resolved. Cancellation and consumption are jobs on the lane mutation line, so `[cancel, consume]` and `[consume, cancel]` are the only histories (section 15).

### Input at the finish boundary

Same-lane decisions have one order: the lane mutation line (section 15). The final pending-work check and the terminal append are one `tryFinishRun` mutation, so a concurrent steer has exactly two histories:

```text
steer first                         finish first
R   queue_enqueued                  R   operation_finished
    tryFinishRun → continue             steer() → NoActiveRun
E   user message
... run continues
R   operation_finished
```

Deferred writes and abort use the same ordering. A deferred write accepted before finish must be applied before the run can close; one accepted after finish observes an idle lane and appends directly. `abort_requested` before finish selects abort reconciliation; abort after finish returns `NoActiveOperation`. There is no third history — that is the entire mechanism.

### Deferred write mid-turn

```text
R   step_attempt                      request in flight, context ends at user message U
    session.appendMessage(M)          caller resolves here
R   write_deferred                    full payload, provisioned id
E   assistant message A               provider cached [.., U, A]
E   message M                         checkpoint applies the write; tail append
```

Appending M directly would produce [.., U, M, A]: a valid provider sequence that invalidates the KV cache from M on, and a transcript claiming A saw M when it did not. The checkpoint prevents both (append-only context, section 4).

### Abort during a tool

```text
E   assistant message [tool call]
R   tool_started
    abort()                           caller resolves here
R   abort_requested                   steer/follow-up queues die; payloads returned
E   tool result                       synthetic "interrupted", or real if it finished
E   assistant message                 closing message, stop reason aborted
R   operation_finished                aborted
```

Crash after `abort_requested`: recovery completes the same reconciliation. Pending deferred writes are applied even here; queued steer/follow-up items are not.

### Tool execution crash sites

```text
E   assistant message, calls c1, c2
X1  before before_tool                nothing durable for c1
H   before_tool(c1)
X2  decision made, nothing written    same as X1
R   tool_started(c1)
X3  tool executing
H   after_tool(c1)
X4  hook interrupted                  same durable state as X3
E   tool result c1
X5  result durable                    c1 finished
```

| crash site | durable state | recovery |
|---|---|---|
| X1, X2 | no record, no result | full normal path; `before_tool` runs (again) |
| X3, X4 | `tool_started`, no result | replay safe (record AND current declaration): re-execute persisted args, `after_tool` on the fresh result. Otherwise: synthetic "interrupted" result, no hooks |
| X5 | result entry exists | skip c1; c2 is at X1 |

Reconciliation handles each call of a batch at its own site, in source order. The step then ends normally.

### Auto-compaction at a checkpoint

```text
E   tool result                       step ends
    checkpoint: next request would not fit
H   before_compaction                 may decline or supply the summary
R   step_attempt                      step compaction — skipped if hook supplied
E   compaction entry
R   step_attempt                      step assistant; run continues on compacted context
```

Auto-compaction writes no `operation_started`; it belongs to the run. Manual `compact()` is its own operation: `operation_started` (kind compaction, provisioned result id) → hook → attempt → compaction entry → `operation_finished`.

### Navigation

```text
    navigateTree(target, { summarize: true, label: "before-refactor" })
R   operation_started                 kind navigation; target, provisioned summary id, label
H   before_navigation                 may decline or supply the summary
R   step_attempt                      step branch_summary — skipped if hook supplied
    summary text generated            in memory only
L   lane move → target                one storage write; the commit point
E   branch summary entry              appends chain to the lane's leaf — now the target,
                                      so the summary lands on the target branch
G   label                             from the intent; latest-wins, idempotent
R   operation_finished                completed
```

The move commits first; every later write chains off durable state. No multi-object atomic write exists anywhere in the design. Acceptance rejects `target === sourceLeafId`, so "has the move happened" is always decidable: the lane's leaf equals `intent.targetId` if and only if the move committed. Per crash site:

| crash after | recovery sees | action |
|---|---|---|
| `operation_started` | leaf at `sourceLeafId` | rerun hook or summary step, then move |
| summary generated | nothing durable of the text | regenerate under the same attempt cap |
| lane move | leaf at `intent.targetId` | append summary if `summaryEntryId` missing |
| summary entry | entry exists | set label, finish |
| label | fact set (idempotent) | finish |

Between the move and `operation_finished`, readers see the lane at the target with an open navigation — a recoverable state, not an invalid one. The lane runs nothing else meanwhile; one operation per lane already guarantees that.

### Deferred provider request

```text
R   step_attempt                      stream options request deferred execution
E   assistant message                 stop reason deferred, carries the handle
    lane suspends; prompt() resolves with outcome "suspended"
    ... hours pass, maybe a different process ...
    resume()                          newest entry on the lane's path is a deferred
                                      assistant message with no successor
                                      → the handle is unredeemed, redeem it
    fetchDeferred(model, handle)      model and handle from that entry
E   assistant message                 the real result
    run continues normally
```

The suspended lane is indistinguishable from a crashed one in storage: an open operation whose newest entry is a deferred assistant message with no successor. Restore lists it as suspended; `resume()` checks the handle. Redemption writes no intent record: it starts no new model work, and a committed successor entry prevents another fetch.

Each `resume()` performs one fetch. Three outcomes:

- **pending** — the provider returns stop reason `deferred` again. Nothing but a possible `usage` record is written (section 15); the lane re-suspends. Poll cadence is application policy.
- **ready** — a normal assistant message. It is appended as the successor and the run continues.
- **terminal** — the provider returns stop reason `error` (expired, unknown, consumed), or the fetch itself rejects; the harness converts a rejection to the same error-message form. The message is appended and the run finishes failed. Redemption failure never starts an automatic replacement request; steering or follow-up input already accepted for this run can still start a later turn.

`abort()` on a suspended lane: `abort_requested` record, best-effort cancellation of the handle at the provider, then normal reconciliation and `operation_finished` aborted. The deferred entry stays in the transcript.

Deferred assistant messages carry a handle, not content; they project to nothing in provider context.

## 7. Recovery

### Restore

Opening a session restores every lane independently. Restore reads; it never appends and never starts effects.

Recovery starts with indexed discovery, not a full log scan:

1. `findOpenOperations(lane, { limit: 2 })` returns unfinished `operation_started` records newest first. Zero means idle, one means suspended, and two means corruption. Backends must answer this from replayed/indexed operation state; callers cannot infer it from only the newest start.
2. For an idle lane, one indexed query finds the newest run-kind `operation_started`, then filtered `queue_enqueued` / `queue_cancelled` queries above it reconstruct pending `nextRun` items. With no prior run, the same type-filtered queries read only pre-run queue state; unrelated usage adjustments are never scanned.
3. For a suspended lane, the open operation selects two bounded payload reads:
   - **The lane's records** since that `operation_started`. Everything after the finish of the previous operation is irrelevant history.
   - **The lane's own entries**: the path from its leaf back to the operation's anchor (`sourceLeafId`). These are exactly the entries this operation appended.

Reduction may additionally perform point lookups for provisioned entry ids and bounded branch lookups for effective model, thinking, and active-tool configuration at the operation anchor. These are indexed lookups, not extra history scans. Every scan is bounded by the open operation or the still-relevant idle queue, not by total session history or another lane's activity.

An idle lane's remaining state is pending next-run queue items. Next-run messages can be enqueued at any time; only the acceptance of a run consumes them — compaction and navigation pass over the queue. Pending items are the `queue_enqueued` records after the lane's most recent run-kind `operation_started` whose provisioned entries do not exist and that no `queue_cancelled` retracts. Items a run captured are listed in its intent's `initialMessages`, so a captured-but-unappended item is completed by that run's recovery and is never offered to the next run.

### The reduction

From those two reads, the lane's state:

- **aborting** — an `abort_requested` record exists.
- **attempts used** — the newest `step_attempt`, when its `resultEntryId` has no entry, is the unfinished step; its `attempt` field is the durable count, its kind and `compactionReason` select the resume path. Closure is a point lookup, not adjacency inference: a step is closed exactly when the newest attempt's provisioned result exists. Earlier attempts' unfulfilled ids belong to finished work and need no inspection.
- **overflow recovery used** — a compaction `step_attempt` with reason `overflow` is newer than the newest consumed conversational message of this run (section 6, overflow guard).
- **tool batch** — the newest assistant entry with tool calls, each call matched against `tool_started` records and result entries (section 6, crash-site table). The assistant stop reason is retained: a `length` batch is truncated and never executes on recovery. Persisted `terminate` values on result entries decide whether the completed batch forces another turn.
- **deferred handle** — the newest own entry is a deferred assistant message with no successor.
- **newest own entry** — the last entry of the second read; the pure predicates (`needsAssistant()`, terminal failure, abort closure) read it.
- **pending queue items** — `queue_enqueued` records whose provisioned entry does not exist, excluding items retracted by `queue_cancelled` and steer/follow-up items killed by this run's `abort_requested`.
- **pending writes** — `write_deferred` records whose provisioned entry does not exist.
- **missing initial messages** — provisioned ids from the run intent without entries.
- **structural targets** — for compaction and navigation: does the provisioned result entry exist.

The same rules run live: during normal execution the harness updates this state in memory as it writes; restore recomputes it from storage. State and records cannot disagree, because the state is defined as their reduction. `usage` records are invisible here: they are accounting, never orchestration.

### Resume

`resume()` continues the open operation from what the reduction says:

- missing initial messages → append them (accepted input is never lost), even when aborting.
- aborting → reconcile: synthetic tool results, closing assistant message, `operation_finished` aborted.
- unresolved tool batch → per call: skip, re-execute, or synthesize (section 6).
- deferred handle → redeem (section 6).
- terminal failure — the newest own message is a step-produced assistant error (a give-up entry, a non-retryable request error, or a failed redemption; never an arbitrary deferred-write message) → apply accepted writes and consume queued conversational input; if nothing consumed starts new work, append `operation_finished` failed. Recovery never completes such a run.
- unfinished step → resume that exact step before consuming new checkpoint input: next attempt if the cap allows, else fail the operation. A compaction step resumes with its recorded `compactionReason`.
- otherwise → continue at the next checkpoint; pending writes and queue items apply normally there.

Recovery appends are ordinary appends with one extra rule: skip any provisioned id that already exists. A crash during recovery therefore leaves less to recover; re-running recovery is always safe. Recovery repeats an unknown effect only when its policy permits it: a retryable step starts a new durable attempt, and a tool replays only when both replay declarations say `safe`. Interrupted hook handlers follow the section 11 replay table.

Old v3 sessions contain no records. Every lane question answers "idle"; section 12 normalization restores `main` at the final retained logical entry (v3 `leaf` entries and discarded fact-like entries resolve through their nearest retained ancestor).

# Part III — API and implementation

## 8. Public API

### The lane surface

`AgentLane` is the operation surface of one lane. `AgentHarness` implements it for `main`: `harness.prompt(...)` is main's prompt. Every method is async, including getters an in-process implementation answers from memory: the interface must be implementable by a remote proxy, so no signature may promise synchronicity that only the local implementation can keep. Sync exceptions: `name`, and listener registration (`hooks.on`, `events.on`) — a server bridges events over its own transport, not registrations.

```ts
interface AgentLane {
  readonly name: string;                 // "main" on the harness itself
  getLeafId(): Promise<string | null>;

  // Operations. Never throw; every call resolves with a result (see below).
  // At most one operation per lane; other lanes are unaffected.
  prompt(text: string, images?: ImageContent[]): Promise<RunResult>;

  navigateTree(targetId: string | null, options?: NavigateOptions): Promise<NavigationResult>;
  resume(): Promise<ResumeResult>;       // continue this lane's open operation
  abort(): Promise<AbortResult>;         // durable on resolve; reconciliation runs in background

  // Queues. Durable on resolve (queue_enqueued record); the returned
  // entryId identifies the item until consumption. steer/followUp require

  steer(text: string, images?: ImageContent[]): Promise<QueueResult>;
  steer(message: AgentMessage): Promise<QueueResult>;

  // Persisted configuration — entries on the path behind this lane's leaf,
  // resolved by point queries. Setters resolve on durable acceptance;
  // while a run is open they become deferred writes on this lane.

  getThinkingLevel(): Promise<ThinkingLevel>; setThinkingLevel(level: ThinkingLevel): Promise<void>;
  getActiveTools(): Promise<string[]>;        setActiveTools(names: string[]): Promise<void>;

  /** This lane's view of the tree: reads default to this lane's leaf;

  session: SessionTree;

  /** Scoped: this lane's transcript, state, queues, and events (section 9). */
  watch(): Promise<{ snapshot: LaneSnapshot; start: (listener) => void; unsubscribe: () => void }>;
}
```

All prompt overloads normalize to `AgentMessage[]`. Text plus images becomes one user message; an input message array keeps its order after validation. Skill and template expansion happens before normalization is stored. This normalized array is `OperationStartedRecord.intent.originalPrompt`; it excludes captured `nextRun` items and hook injections.

### Results and tagged errors

The public API uses a small vendored subset of the `better-result` v3 pattern. `packages/agent` does not take a runtime dependency on `better-result`.

The subset contains only:

- serializable `Result.ok()` and `Result.err()` values;
- `Result.isOk()` and `Result.isErr()` guards;
- `TaggedError` with a literal `_tag`, readonly payload, normal `Error` behavior, `.toJSON()`, and class-level `.is()`;
- exhaustive `matchError()`.

```ts
export type Result<T, E> =
  | { ok: true; value: T }
  | { ok: false; error: E };

export const Result = {
  ok<T>(value: T): Result<T, never> {
    return { ok: true, value };
  },
  err<E>(error: E): Result<never, E> {
    return { ok: false, error };
  },
  isOk<T, E>(result: Result<T, E>): result is { ok: true; value: T } {
    return result.ok;
  },
  isErr<T, E>(result: Result<T, E>): result is { ok: false; error: E } {
    return !result.ok;
  },
};

export interface TaggedErrorValue<Tag extends string> extends Error {
  readonly _tag: Tag;
  toJSON(): { _tag: Tag; message: string } & Record<string, unknown>;
}

export interface TaggedErrorFactory<Tag extends string> {
  new <Props extends { message: string }>(
    props: Props,
  ): TaggedErrorValue<Tag> & Readonly<Props>;
  is(value: unknown): value is TaggedErrorValue<Tag>;
}

export declare function TaggedError<Tag extends string>(tag: Tag): TaggedErrorFactory<Tag>;

export type ErrorMatchers<E extends TaggedErrorValue<string>, R> = {
  [Tag in E["_tag"]]: (error: Extract<E, { _tag: Tag }>) => R;
};

export declare function matchError<E extends TaggedErrorValue<string>, R>(
  error: E,
  matchers: ErrorMatchers<E, R>,
): R;
```

The implementation is expected to stay under about 80 lines, excluding tests. It has no mapping combinators, generator composition, promise wrappers, retry helpers, collection helpers, or `Panic` class. Promise remains the async boundary. `HarnessFault` uses native throwing and promise rejection for defects.

Each expected rejection is one class. Its tag is a string literal. Its fields carry the data a caller needs. Use the v3 class form shown below; do not add a trailing `()` after the property type:

```ts
class LaneBusy extends TaggedError("LaneBusy")<{
  lane: string;
  operationId: string;
  operationKind: "run" | "compaction" | "navigation";
  message: string;
}> {}

class MissingIdentities extends TaggedError("MissingIdentities")<{
  lane: string;
  tools: string[];
  models: string[];
  message: string;
}> {}
```

The remaining classes use the same base:

| class | payload besides `message` |
|---|---|
| `NoActiveRun` | `lane` |
| `NoActiveOperation` | `lane` |
| `NothingToResume` | `lane` |
| `InvalidMessage` | `lane`, `reason` |
| `UnknownSkill` | `name` |
| `UnknownTemplate` | `name` |
| `UnknownTarget` | `targetId` |
| `UnknownQueueItem` | `lane`, `entryId` |
| `LaneExists` | `lane` |
| `InvalidLane` | `lane`, `reason` |
| `NothingToCompact` | `lane` |
| `Closed` | none |

A transport serializes an error as `{ _tag, message, ...payload }` and reconstructs the class at the proxy boundary. Adding a rejection class changes the corresponding error union. An exhaustive `matchError` call then fails to type-check until its caller handles the new tag.

An `Err` means the call did not create or accept the requested work. While the harness remains open and writable, every accepted operation resolves with `Ok`, including `aborted`, `failed`, and `suspended`:

```ts
interface OperationError {
  code: string;
  message: string;
}

type RunOutcome =
  | { kind: "completed"; leafId: string; finalEntryId: string; finalMessage: AssistantMessage }
  | { kind: "aborted";   leafId: string; finalEntryId: string; finalMessage: AssistantMessage }
  | { kind: "failed";    leafId: string; error: OperationError;
                          finalEntryId?: string; finalMessage?: AssistantMessage }
  | { kind: "suspended"; leafId: string; finalEntryId: string; deferred: DeferredHandle };

type CompactionOutcome =
  | { kind: "completed"; leafId: string; entry: CompactionEntry }
  | { kind: "declined";  leafId: string }
  | { kind: "aborted";   leafId: string }
  | { kind: "failed";    leafId: string; error: OperationError };

type NavigationOutcome =
  | { kind: "completed"; newLeafId: string | null; summaryEntry?: BranchSummaryEntry }
  | { kind: "declined";  leafId: string | null }
  | { kind: "aborted";   leafId: string | null }
  | { kind: "failed";    leafId: string | null; error: OperationError };

type RunRejected = LaneBusy | InvalidMessage | UnknownSkill | UnknownTemplate | Closed;
type CompactionRejected = LaneBusy | NothingToCompact | Closed;
type NavigationRejected = LaneBusy | UnknownTarget | Closed;
type ResumeRejected = LaneBusy | NothingToResume | MissingIdentities | Closed;
type QueueRejected = NoActiveRun | InvalidMessage | Closed;
type CancelQueuedRejected = UnknownQueueItem | Closed;
type AbortRejected = NoActiveOperation | Closed;

type RunResult = Result<{ runId: string } & RunOutcome, RunRejected>;
type CompactionResult = Result<{ runId: string } & CompactionOutcome, CompactionRejected>;
type NavigationResult = Result<{ runId: string } & NavigationOutcome, NavigationRejected>;
type QueueResult = Result<{ entryId: string }, QueueRejected>;
type CancelQueuedResult = Result<{
  outcome: "cancelled" | "already_consumed" | "already_cleared";
}, CancelQueuedRejected>;
type RecordUsageResult = Result<void, Closed>;
type AbortResult = Result<{
  runId: string;
  steer: AgentMessage[];
  followUp: AgentMessage[];
}, AbortRejected>;

type ResumeOutcome =
  | ({ operation: "run"; runId: string } & RunOutcome)
  | ({ operation: "compaction"; runId: string } & CompactionOutcome)
  | ({ operation: "navigation"; runId: string } & NavigationOutcome);

type ResumeResult = Result<ResumeOutcome, ResumeRejected>;

type CreateLaneResult = Result<AgentLane, LaneExists | InvalidLane | UnknownTarget | Closed>;
```

`cancelQueued` outcomes mirror the mutation-line histories: `cancelled` means the entry will never be appended; `already_consumed` means the entry exists (the model saw or will see it); `already_cleared` means abort drained the item or an earlier cancel won.

A storage write failure is not an `Err`. It faults the harness and rejects the promise with `HarnessFault`:

```ts
class HarnessFault extends Error {
  readonly cause: unknown;

  constructor(message: string, cause: unknown) {
    super(message);
    this.name = "HarnessFault";
    this.cause = cause;
  }
}

class HarnessClosed extends Error {
  constructor() {
    super("AgentHarness was closed while the operation was active");
    this.name = "HarnessClosed";
  }
}
```

Calls on a faulted harness reject with the same `HarnessFault` instance until the session is reopened. `close()` rejects process-local promises for accepted operations with `HarnessClosed`; their durable operations remain open and resumable. Result-returning calls made after `close()` return `Err(new Closed(...))`; other calls reject with `HarnessClosed`. An invariant violation also rejects. Promise rejection therefore means a defect or a dead harness, not an expected operation outcome. These errors do not belong to public `Result` error unions.

`finalMessage` is the run's newest entry that projects to an assistant message; `finalEntryId` is that entry's id. `leafId` is the lane's leaf when the operation finished — the race-free anchor for branch queries (`findEntriesOnBranch({ start: leafId })`). The two differ when a deferred write was applied after the final assistant message. Full transcripts are not duplicated into results; they are in the session and were delivered as events.

**Type provenance.** Core conversation and tool types (`AgentMessage`, `AgentTool`, `AgentToolResult`, `QueueMode`, `ThinkingLevel`) come from `packages/agent/src/types.ts`. Provider types (`Model`, `Models`, `Usage`, `RetryPolicy`, stream options, deferred handles) come from `packages/ai`. The generic telemetry contract and schema machinery come from `packages/telemetry`; the AI-request and harness span schemas come from `packages/agent/src/harness/telemetry.ts`. Session, harness, hook, event, result, snapshot, navigation, and durable-record types are defined under `packages/agent/src/harness/`. Lowercase helpers in section 15 pseudocode without a definition (`preparation`, `runToolBatchForSingleCall`, request/option bags such as `AssistantRequest` and `FactWrite`) are constructive implementation detail, not contract.

### Suspended operations

```ts
interface SuspendedOperation {
  lane: string;
  kind: "run" | "compaction" | "navigation";
  id: string;
  startedAt: number;                             // Unix ms, from the operation_started record
  reason: "crash" | "deferred";
  prompt?: AgentMessage[];                       // runs: normalized original prompt
  deferred?: DeferredHandle;                     // reason "deferred"
  aborting?: { steer: AgentMessage[]; followUp: AgentMessage[] };  // abort accepted pre-crash;
                                                 // cleared payloads, offered for requeue
  missing: { tools: string[]; models: string[] };  // non-empty: resume() returns Err
}
```

### Examples

```ts
// Interactive pi. suspended has 0 or 1 entries, always "main".
const { harness, suspended } = await AgentHarness.create({ session, models, model });
for (const s of suspended) await (await harness.lane(s.lane))!.resume();
await harness.prompt("fix the bug");
await harness.steer("focus on the tests");
await harness.setModel(opus);

// Slack bot. Channel = session + main; thread = lane, keyed by thread id.
const key = `slack:${threadTs}`;
let thread = await harness.lane(key);
if (!thread) {
  const created = await harness.createLane(key, pingedEntryId);
  if (!created.ok) return handleLaneError(created.error);
  thread = created.value;
}
await thread.prompt("summarize this thread");   // parallel to main and other threads
await thread.setModel(haiku);                   // this thread only
await thread.session.appendMessage(msg);        // this thread's branch

// Thread renderer: this lane only.
const { snapshot, start } = await thread.watch();
render(snapshot.transcript);
start((event) => update(event));

// Deferred run (batch pricing). prompt() parks; a webhook or timer resumes.
const result = await thread.prompt("analyze this mailbox");
if (result.ok && result.value.kind === "suspended") schedulePoll(thread);
// later: await thread.resume();

// Dashboard: inventory + firehose, no transcripts.
const s = await harness.watchSession();
for (const lane of s.snapshot.lanes) {
  if (lane.operation?.status === "suspended") await (await harness.lane(lane.name))!.resume();
}
```

## 9. Snapshots and subscription

A UI needs current state plus every change after it, with no gap. This includes the transport gap: a server that proxies a harness must deliver the snapshot to its client before any event reaches the wire. `watch()` buffers until the consumer arms delivery:

```ts
const { snapshot, start, unsubscribe } = await lane.watch();   // harness.watch() = main's

await send(client, { kind: "snapshot", snapshot });   // snapshot is on the wire
start((event) => send(client, event));                // flush buffer in order, then live
```

`watch()` captures the snapshot and starts buffering in one step. `start(listener)` flushes the buffer in order and switches to live delivery. Each event arrives exactly once, in order. No sequence numbers, no registration race. `unsubscribe()` drops the subscription and its buffer; a watcher that never calls `start()` buffers without bound.

`watch()` is lane-scoped: this lane's transcript, operation state, queues, pending writes, and only this lane's events. A Slack thread renderer sees its thread and nothing else. `watchSession()` is the session-wide observer: lane inventory, no transcripts, unfiltered event stream. A dashboard composes both: `watchSession()` for the overview, `lane.watch()` per opened thread.

```ts
interface QueuedItem {
  entryId: string;                     // correlates with QueueResult and cancelQueued
  message: AgentMessage;
}

interface LaneSnapshot {
  lane: string;
  /** This lane's branch, oldest first: the context window plus its
      compaction entry. Older history is paged via session queries. */
  transcript: Entry[];
  leafId: string | null;

  operation: null | {
    id: string;
    kind: "run" | "compaction" | "navigation";
    status: "running" | "suspended" | "aborting";
    startedAt: number;                   // Unix ms
    /** status "suspended": everything a client needs to offer resume/abort.
        The same data create() returned; a remote UI only sees snapshots. */
    suspended?: SuspendedOperation;
    /** Live progress, when mid-turn. What the watcher would have
        accumulated from streaming events. */
    streamingMessage?: AssistantMessage;
    runningTools: {
      toolCallId: string;
      toolName: string;
      args: unknown;
      partialResult?: AgentToolResult;
    }[];
    retry?: { attempt: number; maxAttempts: number; nextAttemptAt: number };
  };

  queues: { steer: QueuedItem[]; followUp: QueuedItem[]; nextRun: QueuedItem[] };
  pendingWrites: { id: string; entry: ProvisionedEntry }[];

  faulted: boolean;                      // harness-wide, mirrored into every snapshot
}

interface SessionSnapshot {
  lanes: (LaneInfo & { suspended?: SuspendedOperation })[];
  faulted: boolean;
}
```

Rules:

- Configuration is not in snapshots. Getters return the current value; `config_update` events (section 10) tell a UI when to re-read. One source of truth.
- `streamingMessage` and `runningTools` let a client that attaches mid-turn render immediately, without replaying events.
- Reconnect means a new `watch()`. Against a living harness the new snapshot includes live progress. Only process death loses stream state: a restored harness has no partial streams to report, and the snapshot shows the suspended operation instead. The durable transcript is complete either way. Surviving transport drops is the serving layer's job.
- A lane watcher receives the section 10 event vocabulary filtered to its lane, plus harness-global events such as `fault` and `usage`. `watchSession()` and `events.on(type, listener)` receive everything; `events.on` is live-only — no snapshot, no buffer.
- Watchers are independent; each has its own buffer and its own `start()` gate.

## 10. Events

One flat stream. `events.on(type, listener)` receives everything; lane watchers receive their lane's events (section 9).

Guarantees:

- Passive. A throwing listener is caught and reported as a `handler_error` event plus telemetry; it never affects execution. A listener that throws while handling `handler_error` goes to telemetry only.
- Ordered. Delivery follows process order, identical for watchers and `events.on`. Concurrent lanes do not promise `seq`-ordered passive delivery; durable consumers use `getLog()`.
- Not persisted, not replayed. Reconnect means a new `watch()`.
- Events that report durable facts fire after the fact is committed; what an event announces is already queryable.
- Events report final values, after hook transformation.
- Payloads are JSON-serializable and secret-free; a server can proxy them verbatim. Live objects (models, tools) are referenced by name, never embedded.
- Lane-scoped events carry `lane: string` (omitted below); harness-global events omit it — except `usage`, which is delivered harness-globally and carries the record's lane in its payload. Operation-scoped events carry `runId`; turn-scoped events carry `turnId`; recovered work carries `recovery: true`.

### Nesting

```text
run_start
  turn_start
    message_start / message_update* / message_end     assistant committed
    tool_start / tool_update* / tool_end              per call
    message_end                                       tool results, source order
  turn_end
  compaction_start ... compaction_end                 auto, at a checkpoint, when needed
  turn_start ... turn_end                             until nothing is pending
run_end
```

A UI's busy indicator spans `run_start`..`run_end`, and the `compaction_start`/`navigation_start` brackets for standalone operations. Resumed structural operations re-emit their start event (`recovery: true`) so brackets always balance.

Failed attempts emit `retry_scheduled`, then `retry_start`, then `retry_end` when retrying resolves either way. `run_suspend` ends event flow for the parked lane; the next `run_resume` continues it.

## 11. Hooks

Hooks are awaited interception points. Registration mirrors events, with an optional stable registration id:

```ts
const off = harness.hooks.on("before_tool", async (event) => {
  if (event.toolName === "bash") return { block: { reason: "not allowed" } };
});

harness.hooks.on("before_run", async () => ({
  resumeData: { version: 1 },
}), { id: "extension.example" });
```

Semantics, uniform across all hooks:

- Registration is harness-global. Every hook event carries `lane` (omitted below); a handler scopes itself.
- `before_run` and `before_resume` registrations require a stable `id`. An id is unique within one hook name; duplicate registration rejects synchronously. The same extension uses the same id for both hooks across restarts. The runner stores each `before_run` handler's `resumeData` under its id and hands each `before_resume` handler only the value under the same id.
- `before_run` runs on the normalized caller prompt, outside the lane mutation line, before acceptance. It does not see captured nextRun items; the acceptance mutation captures those afterwards (section 15). A rejected acceptance (busy lane) discards the hook output.
- Handlers run sequentially in registration order. Each transformation handler sees the output of the previous one; returned `messages` append and a returned `systemPrompt` replaces the current value.
- A throwing handler does not fail the run: it is skipped, reported via `handler_error`, and the remaining handlers run. One exception: `before_tool` fails closed — a throwing handler blocks the tool. A skipped policy handler must not allow a tool it might have blocked.
- Hook results that feed durable state are persisted before execution proceeds: `before_run` output lands in the `operation_started` record, `before_tool` effective arguments in the `tool_started` record, and the finalized `after_tool` result plus `terminate` decision in the tool-result entry. The hook's return alone is not durable; a crash before that commit can run it again.
- Events report post-hook values; observers never see pre-hook state.

### Catalog

```ts
// Run boundaries ------------------------------------------------------

// Once per run, before acceptance. Not re-run on retry or resume; its
// output is persisted in the operation_started record.

  result: {

    systemPrompt?: string;           // persisted override, fixed for the run
    resumeData?: JsonValue;          // stored under this handler's registration id
  } | undefined;
}

// On resume(), before any effect. Rebuilds process-local extension state.
// Must be idempotent: a crash can rerun it. Cannot rewrite the prompt.
before_resume: {
  event:
    | { runId; kind: "run"; prepared: { prompt: AgentMessage[]; systemPromptOverride? };
        resumeData?: JsonValue }
    | { runId; kind: "compaction" | "navigation"; resumeData?: JsonValue };
  result: void;
}

// At a normal finish boundary: no tool continuation, no queued messages.
// Returned follow-ups continue the same run; the runner commits them
// conditionally — an abort that wins while the hook runs drops the
// follow-up (section 15). Does not run for abort, terminal failure, or

// sees, never what the session contains.

}

  event:  { targetId; preparation: NavigationPreparation };
  result: { decline?: boolean; summary?: { summary: string; details?; usage? } } | undefined;
}
```

### Replay across retry and resume

Hooks re-run only where the work itself re-runs. Persisted outputs are never recomputed.

| hook | fresh | retry | resume |
|---|---|---|---|
| `before_run` | once | no | no (persisted) |
| `before_resume` | no | no | yes, idempotent |
| `transform_context`, `before_request`, `before_payload` | per request | yes | yes |
| `after_response` | per response | per response | per response |
| `before_tool` | per call | — | not when `tool_started` exists |
| `after_tool` | per executed result | — | on safe replay only |
| `before_compaction`, `before_navigation` | per operation | no | not when a result entry or any `step_attempt` for this work exists |
| `before_run_end` | per normal finish boundary | — | at the boundary resume reaches (may repeat); never for abort, terminal failure, or exhausted auto-compaction |

## 12. Session and SessionTree

### Entries

The tree content. No other entry types exist; pointers and global facts are not entries (section 2).

```ts
interface EntryBase {
  type: string;
  id: string;
  seq: number;                 // shared sequence; read-side, storage-assigned
  parentId: string | null;     // storage-assigned: the appending lane's leaf
  timestamp: number;           // Unix ms, storage-assigned
}

interface MessageEntry           extends EntryBase { type: "message"; message: AgentMessage;
                                                     terminate?: true }
interface ModelChangeEntry       extends EntryBase { type: "model_change"; provider: string; modelId: string }
interface ThinkingLevelEntry     extends EntryBase { type: "thinking_level_change"; thinkingLevel: string }
interface ActiveToolsEntry       extends EntryBase { type: "active_tools_change"; activeToolNames: string[] }
interface CompactionEntry        extends EntryBase { type: "compaction"; summary: string;
                                                     retainedTail: AgentMessage[];
                                                     tokensBefore: number; details?; usage? }
interface BranchSummaryEntry     extends EntryBase { type: "branch_summary"; fromId: string; summary: string;
                                                     details?; usage? }
interface CustomEntry            extends EntryBase { type: "custom"; customType: string; data? }

type Entry = MessageEntry | ModelChangeEntry | ThinkingLevelEntry | ActiveToolsEntry
           | CompactionEntry | BranchSummaryEntry | CustomEntry;
```

A harness-written assistant `MessageEntry` always contains a `SettledAssistantMessage`; `pending` is rejected before any durable write. A v4 tool-result `MessageEntry` additionally persists the finalized batch-control decision as `terminate?: true` beside `message`. It is orchestration state for the reduction (section 7), never model context; the projection to provider messages ignores it. `AgentToolResult.terminate` exists at the tool API level but `ToolResultMessage` does not carry it, so the entry field is the durable form.

Every v4 compaction — generated or hook-supplied — stores the complete `retainedTail`; an empty tail is `[]`, never omission. The compaction entry is a self-contained checkpoint: context builds never read past it. Entry `usage` fields — on assistant messages, tool results, compactions, and branch summaries — are immutable display snapshots of the response(s) that produced that entry: a message entry matches its one producing record; a compaction or branch-summary entry carries its successful attempt's request(s), never failed attempts. The durable ledger is the `usage` records; effective cost including later adjustments is a read-time ledger query by `entryId` (sections 5, 13).

v3 files additionally contain `custom_message`, `label`, `session_info`, and `leaf` entries, plus old compaction entries that use `firstKeptEntryId`. Load normalizes them before exposing the v4 tree:

- `custom_message` becomes a custom agent message.
- `label` and `session_info` become global facts (latest by file position wins) and disappear from the logical tree. A label targets its nearest retained parent.
- `leaf` entries disappear; `main`'s leaf resolves through the last `leaf` entry, then to the nearest retained ancestor if that target was discarded.
- Each retained child of a discarded entry is reparented to the discarded entry's nearest retained ancestor.
- An old compaction resolves `firstKeptEntryId` against its own branch and materializes that range as `retainedTail`. V4 never exposes or persists `firstKeptEntryId`.
- v3 entry timestamps are ISO strings and convert to Unix milliseconds.

Read-only opens keep the physical v3 file unchanged; the first v4 write persists the normalized form (section 13).

### SessionTree

The tree-facing contract. Each lane exposes one view (`lane.session`); `Session` itself implements it for `main`. Reads pass through always. A write through a lane view enters that lane's mutation line: while a run is open — including suspension and cancellation — it becomes a durable deferred write; during compaction or navigation it waits for the operation to end; on an idle lane it appends directly. Writes on a standalone `Session` (no harness attached) apply immediately.

```ts
interface EntryQuery {
  type?: Entry["type"];
  customType?: string;                     // for type "custom"
  order?: "newestFirst" | "oldestFirst";   // default newestFirst
  limit?: number;
  cursor?: EntryCursor;
}

/** Bounds of a branch scan. Default: the whole path, leaf to root. */
interface BranchBounds {
  start?: string;              // default: the view's lane leaf
  stopAtType?: Entry["type"];  // scan ends after the first match, inclusive
  stopAtId?: string;
}

interface SessionTree {
  getLeafId(): Promise<string | null>;
  getEntry(id: string): Promise<Entry | undefined>;
  getStats(): Promise<SessionStats>;

  // Global facts. Latest wins; not branch-scoped. "set", not "append":
  // append vocabulary is reserved for tree writes.
  getName(): Promise<string | undefined>;
  setName(name: string): Promise<void>;
  getLabel(targetId: string): Promise<string | undefined>;
  setLabel(targetId: string, label: string | undefined): Promise<void>;

  /** Session-wide, all branches, sequence order. */
  findEntries(query?: EntryQuery): Promise<Entry[]>;
  findEntry(query?: EntryQuery): Promise<Entry | undefined>;

  /** Branch-scoped: the path from start toward root. */
  findEntriesOnBranch(query?: EntryQuery & BranchBounds): Promise<Entry[]>;
  findEntryOnBranch(query?: EntryQuery & BranchBounds): Promise<Entry | undefined>;

  // Writes. Resolve on durable acceptance; the returned id is the entry's
  // id (provisioned when the write defers).
  appendMessage(message: AgentMessage): Promise<string>;
  appendCustomEntry(customType: string, data?: unknown): Promise<string>;
}
```

Query semantics: a branch scan takes the path from `start` to root, walks it in `order` direction, stops after a `stopAt` match (inclusive), filters, then applies `limit` and `cursor`.

- `newestFirst` with `stopAtType: "compaction"` ends at the newest compaction: the context window.
- `type` and `customType` filter results; a `stopAt` entry is returned only if it passes the filter.
- Extension patterns: effective state = `findEntryOnBranch({ type: "custom", customType })`; collections = `findEntriesOnBranch(...)`; global inventory = `findEntries(...)`.
- Context build is a branch scan with `stopAtType: "compaction"`, projected through `entryProjectors` and `toProviderMessages`. Its projection is the compaction summary, the materialized `retainedTail`, then the entries after the compaction; nothing before the compaction is read.
- `SessionTree` has no navigation; moving a lane is `navigateTree()` on the lane.

Read consistency: finders and `getEntry` return committed entries only. A deferred write is not in the tree until applied; a handler that appends and immediately queries does not see its own write. Pending writes are visible in the snapshot, correlated by provisioned id.

### Session

`Session` adds the lane surface and the record log. It is usable standalone — no harness required. In production the harness writes records; recovery fixtures and Tier A tests prefill them through the same API. Lanes, entries, and facts are Session-level.

```ts
class Session implements SessionTree {          // bound to "main"
  constructor(storage: SessionStorage, options?: { idGenerator?: IdGenerator });
  /** Process-local id provisioning used by Session and harness. Default
      UUIDv7; tests inject a deterministic generator. Sync by design. */
  readonly idGenerator: IdGenerator;

  /** SessionTree bound to a lane: reads default to its leaf, appends chain
      to it and advance it. The only write-binding mechanism; no SessionTree
      method takes a lane parameter. view("main") behaves like the Session. */
  view(lane: string): SessionTree;

  // Lanes — permanent named pointers. Durable via storage (section 13).
  getLanes(): Promise<{ lane: string; leafId: string | null }[]>;
  createLane(lane: string, at: string | null): Promise<void>;   // rejects existing names
  moveLane(lane: string, to: string | null): Promise<void>;

  /** Low-level provisioned append for the harness, recovery, and test
      fixtures. Bypasses the SessionTree deferral policy; a harness caller
      already holds the lane mutation line. */
  appendEntry<T extends Entry>(entry: ProvisionedEntry<T>, lane: string): Promise<T>;

  // Records — harness and recovery write these; applications may append
  // usage adjustment records (section 5) and nothing else.
  appendRecord<T extends LaneRecord>(record: NewRecord<T>): Promise<T>;
  findRecords<K extends LaneRecord["type"]>(
    query: RecordQuery & { type: K },
  ): Promise<Extract<LaneRecord, { type: K }>[]>;
  findRecords(query?: RecordQuery): Promise<LaneRecord[]>;
  /** Unfinished operation starts, newest first. limit: 2 distinguishes the
      valid zero/one states from multiple-open-operation corruption. */
  findOpenOperations(lane: string, options?: { limit?: number }): Promise<OperationStartedRecord[]>;
  /** Full chronological view: entries, records, facts, lane moves,
      merged by seq. Debugging and tests. */
  getLog(options?: { afterSeq?: number; limit?: number }): Promise<LogItem[]>;
}

interface IdGenerator { next(): string; }

interface RecordQuery {
  lane?: string;
  type?: LaneRecord["type"];
  runId?: string;
  /** Valid only with type "operation_started". */
  operationKind?: OperationStartedRecord["intent"]["kind"];
  afterSeq?: number;
  order?: "oldestFirst" | "newestFirst";
  limit?: number;
}
```

`Session` exposes no `getStorage()` escape hatch: all writes flow through `Session`, which is the single writer the storage contract assumes.

**Ownership rule:** after an application passes a `Session` to `AgentHarness.create()`, it mutates that session only through the harness and its lane views until `close()` resolves. Concurrent writes through the original standalone reference are unsupported caller misuse; the harness adds no machinery for it.

## 13. Storage

### Contract

One session per storage instance. Storage persists and answers queries; `Session` owns validation and view binding. Storage never executes operations, queues, or recovery. Record payloads are opaque except for indexed columns and the required open-operation recovery projection.

```ts
interface SessionStorage {
  getMetadata(): Promise<SessionMetadata>;

  // Lanes
  getLanes(): Promise<{ lane: string; leafId: string | null }[]>;
  createLane(lane: string, at: string | null): Promise<void>;
  moveLane(lane: string, to: string | null): Promise<void>;

  /** Durable on resolve. Input carries no parentId, seq, or timestamp;
      storage assigns all three. parentId is the lane's current leaf; the
      entry becomes the lane's new leaf, in the same transaction. Callers
      cannot pass a stale parent because they never pass one. */
  appendEntry<T extends Entry>(entry: ProvisionedEntry<T>, lane: string): Promise<T>;
  appendRecord<T extends LaneRecord>(record: NewRecord<T>): Promise<T>;

  // Reads
  getEntry(id: string): Promise<Entry | undefined>;
  findEntries(query?: EntryQuery): Promise<Entry[]>;
  /** start is mandatory here; defaulting to a lane's leaf is view sugar. */
  findEntriesOnBranch(query: EntryQuery & BranchBounds & { start: string }): Promise<Entry[]>;
  findRecords<K extends LaneRecord["type"]>(
    query: RecordQuery & { type: K },
  ): Promise<Extract<LaneRecord, { type: K }>[]>;
  findRecords(query?: RecordQuery): Promise<LaneRecord[]>;
  findOpenOperations(lane: string, options?: { limit?: number }): Promise<OperationStartedRecord[]>;
  getLog(options?): Promise<LogItem[]>;

  // Global facts
  getName(): Promise<string | undefined>;      setName(name: string): Promise<void>;
  getLabel(id: string): Promise<string | undefined>;  setLabel(id, label): Promise<void>;
  getStats(): Promise<SessionStats>;
}
```

Contract rules, all backends:

- One monotonic `seq` across entries, records, facts, and lane moves.
- Storage linearizes concurrent writes from all lanes of the session and allocates `seq` inside each write's atomic commit; callers never read, reserve, or increment the sequence. Write promises resolve in commit order. The lane mutation line (section 15) serializes decisions; this rule serializes the writes underneath them — both are needed, neither replaces the other.
- A write is durable when its promise resolves; events fire after.
- `Session` and the harness provision ids with `session.idGenerator`; storage enforces per-session uniqueness at append.
- Every durable payload must be JSON-serializable. `Session` validates before dispatch so Memory, JSONL, and SQLite accept the same values; Memory does not retain values JSONL would reject.
- Reads return immutable data.
- `findOpenOperations` is a required recovery projection: Memory maintains it with its record state, JSONL derives it while replaying the file, and SQLite answers it from the lane's current open-operation projection. It returns unfinished starts newest first and must expose a second result when a replayed/imported backend observes multiple open operations so recovery can reject corruption. Backends with conditional current-state projections may reject a second `operation_started` append instead of creating that corruption through their normal write API.
- No general conditional writes exist. Single-writer plus the lane mutation line make compare-and-set unnecessary for normal appends and pointer/fact updates. The lane open-operation projection is the narrow exception: starting an operation conditionally sets the lane's open operation from `null` to the run id, and a failed update means the lane is already busy.
- One writer per session, enforced by the serving layer; SQLite additionally rejects a second writer itself. Per session, not per backend: one SQLite database hosts many sessions, each with its own single writer.
- Any write failure faults the harness (section 4). The store is left a valid prefix.
- Global-fact and lane-move history is kept, never rewritten: latest by `seq` wins. History is the cheaper implementation (insert, never update), and lane-move history is a reflog if anyone ever wants one.
- For format-4 sessions, the token and cost fields returned by `getStats()` are the sum of `usage` records across all lanes — one rule, no entry-derived billing, and no double counting by construction. `messageCount` counts all message entries in the session tree, including entries copied into a fork. A fork initializes the count from its copied entries, then increments it for newly appended message entries. Backends maintain both as running projections, so reads and the `usage` event's totals are O(1). Format-3 sessions have no records; their usage stats stay entry-derived. The one-time v4 conversion writes one aggregate `adjustment` record (`details: { source: "v3-import" }`) summing the v3 entries' usage, so totals survive conversion. Outside the ledger's claim: the settle-to-write crash window, unreported mid-stream billing, tools that die without reporting, and extension-private LLM calls (section 1 non-goal) — though `adjustment` records let an application close even those after the fact.

### Memory

Plain structures: entry map, record list, lane map, fact lists, one seq counter, one session-wide write queue. Append validates, clones, allocates `seq` at the head of that queue, commits; reads clone out. The reference implementation: the parity test suite runs against it first.

### JSONL

The concrete repository is `JsonlSessionRepo`. Its metadata and options extend the backend-neutral contracts:

```ts
interface JsonlSessionMetadata extends SessionMetadata {
  cwd: string;
  path: string;
  modifiedAt: number;                 // filesystem mtime used for listing order
  sourceFormat: 3 | 4;
  /** Present only when a v3 parent path could not yet be resolved to an id. */
  legacyParentSessionPath?: string;
}
interface JsonlSessionCreateOptions extends SessionCreateOptions {
  cwd: string;
  metadata?: Record<string, JsonValue>;
}
interface JsonlSessionListOptions { cwd?: string; }
```

A v3 `parentSession` path resolves to the parent header's id when that file is available. If it is unavailable, metadata retains `legacyParentSessionPath`; first-write conversion preserves that optional header field rather than silently dropping the relationship. Format-4 code uses `parentSessionId` for repository relationships. `modifiedAt` is read from the filesystem and is not a sequenced session mutation.

The repository layout matches coding-agent v3. Under `sessionsRoot`, each resolved cwd uses a directory named `--${resolvedCwd.replace(/^[/\\]/, "").replace(/[/\\:]/g, "-")}--`. New files are named `${createdAtIso.replace(/[:.]/g, "-")}_${sessionId}.jsonl`. `list({ cwd })` scans that cwd's directory; `list()` scans every direct child directory. First-write v3 conversion replaces the original file in place and never changes its directory or filename.

One file per session: a header line, then one JSON object per line, in `seq` order. Every logical mutation is exactly one line; a line is the atomic unit.

```text
{"kind":"header", "version":4, id, createdAt, cwd, parentSessionId?, legacyParentSessionPath?, metadata?}
{"kind":"entry",  "lane":"main", id, parentId, type, timestamp, ...}  // append; advances main
{"kind":"entry",  id, parentId, type, timestamp, ...}                    // fork import; advances no lane
{"kind":"record", "lane":"main", id, runId?, type, timestamp, ...}
{"kind":"lane",   "lane":"slack:t1", "leafId":"e42"}        // create or move
{"kind":"fact",   "fact":"name",  "name":"Refactor auth"}
{"kind":"fact",   "fact":"label", "targetId":"e17", "label":"checkpoint"}
```

- Open reads the whole file into memory; all queries run against that state. One session-wide append queue serializes writes from every lane, one line each; the queue allocates `seq`, and its order is the line order. Every storage mutation in this section is exactly one line — nothing in the design needs a multi-line atomic write.
- The repository does not retain created or opened storage instances. It knows how to locate and load sessions, then transfers each storage and its write queue to the returned `Session`. Reopening loads a fresh storage instance; the serving layer's single-writer ownership rule prevents concurrent opens for writing. Repository operations are not serialized, so callers await operations with ordering dependencies.
- The optional `lane` on an entry line is envelope metadata and dies at decode. When present, the line atomically appends the entry and advances that lane; replay requires `parentId` to equal its current leaf. When absent, the line imports a fork entry without moving a lane. Entries expose `seq` but no lane.
- Torn tail: a malformed final line is the append that died mid-write. Open truncates it; the write was never acknowledged, nothing is lost. A malformed line anywhere else is corruption; open rejects.
- Durability is process-crash level: a resolved append call. No fsync promise; if power-loss durability is ever needed, it becomes an explicit capability.
- v3 files: entries only, no `kind` tags. Open builds the normalized logical tree from section 12; every entry belongs to `main`, and `main`'s leaf resolves through the last `leaf` entry to its nearest retained ancestor. Before the first v4 append, the file is rewritten once with a v4 header (write temp, rename). This is the single conversion the compatibility policy allows. Read-only opens never rewrite.

### SQLite

SQLite uses a greenfield schema with one persisted leaf per lane.

```sql
session_sequences (session_id, next_seq)                    -- atomic seq allocator
entries        (session_id, seq, id, parent_id, type, timestamp, payload)
records        (session_id, seq, id, lane, run_id, type, op_kind, timestamp, payload)
lanes          (session_id, lane, leaf_id, open_operation_id) -- current pointer + open op projection
lane_moves     (session_id, seq, lane, leaf_id)     -- history; getLog parity
facts          (session_id, seq, kind, key, value)  -- name, labels; latest by seq
branch_entries (session_id, branch_id, entry_id, entry_seq, entry_type, custom_type)
branch_tips    (session_id, branch_id, tip_id)      -- PRIMARY KEY (session_id, tip_id)
writer_leases (session_id, owner_id, fence, expires_at_ms)  -- writer claim

-- indexes
records:        (session_id, lane, type, seq), (session_id, lane, type, op_kind, seq)
branch_entries: (session_id, branch_id, entry_type, entry_seq)
                (session_id, entry_id)              -- reverse lookup: entry → branches
```

`writer_leases` enforces one writer per session with expiring, fenced claims. Storage renews the claim inside every write transaction and while idle. Repository-owned cleanup releases only its matching owner and fence.

`open()` acquires that writer claim. `list()` never acquires or renews writer leases: it reads every matching session directly from the session catalog and projects the latest name fact into the top-level `SqliteSessionMetadata.name` field for server-side inventory. Application-owned `SqliteSessionMetadata.metadata` remains unchanged.

`branch_entries` and `branch_tips` are a private read cache. No interface exposes them; no other backend has them; rebuilding them from parent pointers is an explicit repair operation, never a runtime fallback.

Two invariants carry the whole design:

- **Every entry is in at least one branch.** Every append inserts its entry into a branch (extend or copy, below). A branch holds a full root path; below any entry it contains, it agrees with every other branch containing that entry, because parent chains are unique.
- **Tips are unique.** A branch only ever ends in the entry that was just created — extension and copy both place a brand-new entry at the end — so no two branches share a tip. `branch_tips` answers "does a branch end at X" with one point lookup, 0 or 1 rows.

**Read plan** — `findEntriesOnBranch({ start })`, any entry, tip or not:

1. Reverse index: look up `start` → any containing branch.
2. Range scan that branch, `entry_seq <= start.seq` (parent-before-child makes path order equal seq order), join entries, apply filters and stops.

**Append plan** — `appendEntry(entry, lane)`, one transaction. The storage instance queues writes before opening the transaction; the transaction increments the session's sequence row and uses the returned value, so concurrent lane calls cannot receive the same `seq` and their promises resolve in that order.

1. `leaf = lanes[lane].leaf_id`; allocate `seq` from `session_sequences`; insert the entry with `parent_id = leaf`.
2. `branch_tips` lookup: does a branch end at `leaf`?
   - Yes → insert one `branch_entries` row there; update that tip to the new entry.
   - No → new branch: copy rows `entry_seq <= leaf.seq` from any branch containing `leaf`, insert the new entry's row, insert its tip. (Empty lane: no copy, just the new branch.)
3. `lanes[lane].leaf_id = entry.id`. Update fact/stats projections. Commit, then events.

The four cases, `Bn: [...]` are one branch's rows in seq order:

```text
Case 1 — plain append. The overwhelmingly common case: one lookup, one row.

  tree: a(1)─b(2)─c(3)      lanes: main→c       cache: B1:[a b c]
  main appends d(4):        a branch ends at c → extend
  tree: a─b─c─d             lanes: main→d       cache: B1:[a b c d]

Case 2 — two lanes, one leaf. First extends, second copies.

  lanes: main→c, t1→c                           cache: B1:[a b c]
  t1 appends u(4):          B1 ends at c → extend        B1:[a b c u]
    (B1 now runs past main's leaf — harmless: main's reads stop at seq ≤ 3)
  main appends d(5):        no branch ends at c → copy   B2:[a b c d]
  tree: a─b─c─u                                 lanes: main→d, t1→u
            └─d

Case 3 — lane parked mid-history. createLane("t2", at=b), then append.

  lanes: main→d, t2→b                           cache: B1:[a b c u], B2:[a b c d]
  t2 reads:                 b found in B1 (or B2), scan seq ≤ 2 — nothing built
  t2 appends x(6):          no branch ends at b → copy   B3:[a b x]

Case 4 — a branch still ends at an entry that has children.

  From case 2: B1:[a b c u], B2:[a b c d]; t1 navigates away, main navigates to c.
  main appends e(7):        c has children (u, d) — but the tip test asks the
                            right question: does a branch END at c? No → copy.
  If instead a branch DID end there (its continuation had gone to another
  branch's copy), the tip test extends it — one row instead of a path copy.
  The has-children test would copy needlessly; the tip test never does.
```

Stale branches (no lane resolves through them) are kept.

Every restore query is an index seek plus a bounded scan: a lane's open operation via `(lane, type, seq)`, its last run-kind start via `(lane, type, op_kind, seq)`, its records above the operation via the same index, its own entries via the read plan from its leaf. No query touches another lane's traffic.

## 14. Agent-loop building blocks

`agent-loop.ts` exposes building blocks that own no durable state and know nothing about sessions, records, or lanes. The harness composes them and inserts durability writes between their phases.

### Streaming one assistant response

```ts
export interface StreamAssistantConfig {
  model: Model;
  systemPrompt?: string;
  tools?: AgentTool[];
  /** AgentMessage[] → AgentMessage[]. Pruning, injection. */
  transformContext?: (messages: AgentMessage[], signal?: AbortSignal) => Promise<AgentMessage[]>;
  /** AgentMessage[] → provider messages. */
  toProviderMessages: (messages: AgentMessage[]) => Message[] | Promise<Message[]>;
  /** Dispatch. models.streamSimple resolves auth per request (credential
      store, expiring tokens, header merge, env, baseUrl) — no auth surface
      on this config. streamFn overrides dispatch for tests. */
  models: Models;
  streamFn?: StreamFn;
  /** SimpleStreamOptions carries apiKey/headers/env overrides, transport,
      timeouts, metadata, deferred — and onPayload/onResponse, the mounting
      points for the before_payload and after_response hooks. */
  streamOptions?: SimpleStreamOptions;
  /** Explicit parent for request telemetry. Section 18. */
  telemetryContext: TelemetryContext;
  signal?: AbortSignal;
}

/** One provider request. Emits message_start / message_update / message_end
    to the sink; returns the final assistant message. Provider errors are
    in-band: stopReason "error" | "aborted" | "deferred". Does not mutate
    its inputs — persistence is the caller's job. */
export function streamAssistant(
  messages: AgentMessage[],
  config: StreamAssistantConfig,
  emit: AgentEventSink,
): Promise<SettledAssistantMessage>;
```

### Tool execution

Tools declare recovery safety. Omission means `"never"`:

```ts
interface AgentTool {
  replay?: "never" | "safe";
  // existing fields
}
```

Three phases per call, exposed separately because the harness needs to write between them and recovery needs phase 2 and 3 without phase 1:

```ts
type PreparedToolCall  = { kind: "prepared"; toolCall: AgentToolCall; tool: AgentTool; args: unknown };
type ImmediateOutcome  = { kind: "immediate"; result: AgentToolResult; isError: true };
                         // unknown tool, invalid args, blocked, aborted
type FinalizedToolCall = { toolCall: AgentToolCall; result: AgentToolResult; isError: boolean };

/** Phase 1 — clearance. Tool lookup, prepareArguments, schema validation,
    beforeToolCall (may replace args or block), validation of replacement
    args, abort checks. No effect starts here. */
export function prepareToolCall(
  toolCall: AgentToolCall, tools: AgentTool[], callbacks: ToolCallbacks,
  telemetryContext: TelemetryContext, signal?: AbortSignal,
): Promise<PreparedToolCall | ImmediateOutcome>;

/** Phase 2 — the effect. Streams tool_execution_update via the sink and
    drains pending update events before resolving. Never throws; failures
    become error results. */
export function executeToolCall(
  prepared: PreparedToolCall, emit: AgentEventSink,
  telemetryContext: TelemetryContext, signal?: AbortSignal,
): Promise<{ result: AgentToolResult; isError: boolean }>;

/** Phase 3 — afterToolCall patch, field by field; a throwing callback
    becomes an error result. */
export function finalizeToolCall(
  prepared: PreparedToolCall, executed: { result; isError }, callbacks: ToolCallbacks,
  telemetryContext: TelemetryContext, signal?: AbortSignal,
): Promise<FinalizedToolCall>;

/** content ?? [] normalization, addedToolNames passthrough, timestamp. */
export function createToolResultMessage(finalized: FinalizedToolCall): ToolResultMessage;
export function createErrorToolResult(text: string): AgentToolResult;

export interface ToolCallbacks {
  beforeToolCall?(call, args, signal): Promise<{
    args?: Record<string, unknown>;
    block?: { reason: string };
  } | undefined>;
  afterToolCall?(call, args, result, isError, signal): Promise<ToolResultPatch | undefined>;
  /** Between phases 1 and 2: the durability point. The harness writes its
      tool_started record here. Called in source order in both modes —
      preparation is always sequential. */
  onToolStart?(call: AgentToolCall, effectiveArgs: Record<string, unknown>): Promise<void>;
  /** After phase 3, before the result message is emitted; source order.
      The harness appends the result entry here, persisting the finalized
      terminate decision on it (section 12). */
  onToolResult?(message: ToolResultMessage, terminate: boolean): Promise<void>;
}

/** Batch-driver rules:
    - stopReason "length" fails every call without executing: streamed
      arguments are salvage-parsed and can validate while silently
      truncated; none are safe.
    - Mode: sequential when options.toolExecution === "sequential" or when
      any called tool declares executionMode "sequential"; else parallel.
    - Parallel mode: phase 1 and onToolStart run sequentially in source
      order; phase 2 runs concurrently; phases 3, onToolResult, and message

export function executeToolBatch(
  assistant: AssistantMessage, tools: AgentTool[], callbacks: ToolCallbacks,
  options: { toolExecution?: "sequential" | "parallel" }, emit: AgentEventSink,

): Promise<{ messages: ToolResultMessage[]; terminate: boolean }>;
```

### Compatibility wrapper

The existing public interface of `agent-loop.ts` does not break. Every export keeps its signature and behavior: `agentLoop`, `agentLoopContinue`, `runAgentLoop`, `runAgentLoopContinue`, `AgentEventSink`, and the config surface they consume (`getSteeringMessages`, `getFollowUpMessages`, `prepareNextTurn`, `shouldStopAfterTurn`, `beforeToolCall`, `afterToolCall`, event order included). They compose `streamAssistant` and `executeToolBatch` with the no-op `TelemetryContext` — no durability, no new semantics. The existing `agent-loop` and `agent` test suites pass unchanged.

## 15. Harness internals

The code below is the specification of harness behavior, composed from the section 14 blocks. Live calls and resume run the same procedures: `prompt()` runs `runProcedure()` after acceptance; `resume()` runs it with the operation already recorded. Everything is lane-scoped; procedures of different lanes run concurrently and meet only at the storage append path.

Part III adds no new durability semantics over Part II. It adds two mechanisms: the **effects boundary**, which makes every crash site steppable, and the **lane mutation line**, which closes the check-then-act races between a running procedure and the public lane surface.

### The effects boundary

Every effect a procedure performs goes through one injected `Effects` handle, `fx`. In `drive: "automatic"` the handle passes straight through to the session, the models, the tools, and the hook runner. In `drive: "manual"` the same handle is wrapped in a gate (below). The method list is the complete crash-site catalog: stopping before or after one of these calls is exactly a section 6 X state.

```ts
interface Effects {
  // Durable writes. Each validates and commits at the head of the lane's
  // mutation line (below), then updates LaneState.
  appendEntry(entry: ProvisionedEntry, telemetryContext: TelemetryContext): Promise<Entry>;
  appendRecord<T extends LaneRecord>(record: NewRecord<T>, telemetryContext: TelemetryContext): Promise<T>;
  moveLane(to: string | null, telemetryContext: TelemetryContext): Promise<void>;
  setFact(fact: FactWrite, telemetryContext: TelemetryContext): Promise<void>;

  // Conditional commits. Decision and write in one mutation-line job.
  tryFinishRun(runId: string, outcome: "completed" | "failed",
               telemetryContext: TelemetryContext,
               error?: OperationError): Promise<"finished" | "continue">;
  finishOperation(runId: string, outcome: "completed" | "declined" | "failed" | "aborted",
                  telemetryContext: TelemetryContext,
                  error?: OperationError): Promise<"finished" | "continue">;
  commitRunEndFollowUp(runId: string, item: ProvisionedEntry,
                       telemetryContext: TelemetryContext): Promise<"committed" | "dropped">;
  consumeQueueItem(runId: string, queue: "steer" | "followUp", entryId: string,
                   telemetryContext: TelemetryContext): Promise<"consumed" | "skipped">;
  applyPendingWrite(runId: string, entryId: string,
                    telemetryContext: TelemetryContext): Promise<"applied" | "skipped">;

  // External effects.
  streamAssistant(request: AssistantRequest,
                  telemetryContext: TelemetryContext): Promise<SettledAssistantMessage>;
  executeTool(prepared: PreparedToolCall,
              telemetryContext: TelemetryContext): Promise<{ result: AgentToolResult; isError: boolean }>;
  fetchDeferred(model: Model, handle: DeferredHandle,
                telemetryContext: TelemetryContext): Promise<SettledAssistantMessage>;
  cancelDeferred(model: Model, handle: DeferredHandle,
                 telemetryContext: TelemetryContext): Promise<void>;

  // Interception and time.
  runHook<K extends HookName>(name: K, event: HookEvent<K>,
                              telemetryContext: TelemetryContext): Promise<HookResult<K>>;
  sleep(delayMs: number, telemetryContext: TelemetryContext): Promise<"elapsed" | "aborted">;
}
```

Rules:

- Reads (`getEntry`, `findEntriesOnBranch`, context building, id allocation) are not effects and never gate.
- **Construction rule:** procedures receive only `fx` plus their current `TelemetryContext` — never the session, models, tools, or hook runner directly. Every `Effects` call receives that context as its final non-payload parameter; section 15 procedure snippets omit repetitive context threading where it would obscure control flow and show it where parentage matters. Tool objects handed to `executeToolBatch` are wrapped so each `execute` routes through `fx.executeTool`; the section 14 callbacks route through `fx.runHook`, `fx.appendRecord`, and `fx.appendEntry`, always with the current scope context. The rule is enforced by construction and by a test: any operation driven in manual mode performs zero storage writes and zero provider or tool calls while parked.
- `fx.streamAssistant` wraps section 14 `streamAssistant` with authenticated dispatch through `Models`; `transform_context`, `before_payload`, and `after_response` run inside it via `fx.runHook`. Summary steps force `deferred: false`; a deferred structural result is a defect.
- The `fx` implementation converts a rejected `fetchDeferred` into a `stopReason: "error"` assistant message, so expected provider failures stay in-band. Unexpected rejections from durable writes fault the harness (section 4).

### The lane mutation line

Every race in this design has one shape: a decision is made from lane state, an `await` passes, then a durable write commits the stale decision. The fix is structural. Each lane has one process-local FIFO — a promise chain — and every state-dependent decision commits inside one job on it:

```ts
let tail: Promise<unknown> = Promise.resolve();

function mutateLane<T>(job: () => Promise<T>): Promise<T> {
  const result = tail.then(job);
  tail = result.then(() => undefined, () => undefined);
  return result;
}
```

A job is: validate against live `LaneState` → at most one durable write → update `LaneState`. Nothing else. Provider requests, tool executions, hooks, and backoff never run inside a job; they run between jobs, which is exactly why every commit revalidates inside its own job. Because jobs run one at a time, two concurrent operations on a lane have exactly two possible histories — `[A, B]` or `[B, A]` — and both are defined outcomes. No third, interleaved history exists.

The jobs, by caller:

- **Lane surface** (ungated, enqueue directly):
  - *Operation acceptance* — validate idle, capture the pending `nextRun` items into `initialMessages`, write `operation_started`, set `state.operation`. The second of two concurrent acceptances sees the first and rejects `busy` with no write. `before_run` ran before this job, outside the line, on the prompt only.
  - *Queue acceptance* (`steer`, `followUp`) — validate an active, non-aborting run; write `queue_enqueued`. `nextRun` validates nothing and always accepts.
  - *Queue cancellation* (`cancelQueued`) — no `queue_enqueued` for the id: `Err(UnknownQueueItem)`; target entry exists: `already_consumed`; not pending (abort-drained or already cancelled): `already_cleared`; else write `queue_cancelled` and remove the item from its pending set.
  - *Deferred-write acceptance* (lane-view writes, config setters) — run open: write `write_deferred`; structural operation open: wait for it to end, then re-enter; idle: append the entry directly.
  - *Abort* — write `abort_requested`, set `aborting`, drain `pendingSteer`/`pendingFollowUp` (payloads return to the abort caller and in the `run_abort` event), signal the active effect's `AbortController`.
  - *Resume admission* — reserve the lane's single execution slot; no write.
- **Procedure via `fx`** (gated in manual mode):
  - `tryFinishRun` — if aborting or anything pending, write nothing and return `"continue"`; else write `operation_finished` and idle the lane.
  - `consumeQueueItem` — if the item is still pending and the run is not aborting, append its entry and remove it; else `"skipped"`.
  - `applyPendingWrite` — same shape for deferred writes; they apply even while aborting.
  - `commitRunEndFollowUp` — write `queue_enqueued` only while the run is active and non-aborting; else `"dropped"`.
  - `finishOperation` — terminal record unless preempted: a non-abort outcome returns `"continue"` when an abort marker exists; an `"aborted"` outcome returns `"continue"` while deferred writes are still pending, so reconciliation applies them first.
  - Plain `appendEntry`/`appendRecord`/`moveLane`/`setFact` — unconditional single writes, still serialized by the line.

Two examples, both orders legal, nothing else possible:

```text
steer vs finish                          abort vs before_run_end follow-up
[steer, finish]:                         [abort, commit]:
  queue_enqueued; pendingSteer=[x]         abort_requested; queues drained
  tryFinishRun → "continue"                commitRunEndFollowUp → "dropped"
  run consumes the steer                   reconciliation; no record after abort
[finish, steer]:                         [commit, abort]:
  operation_finished; lane idle            queue_enqueued committed
  steer → NoActiveRun, no write            abort drains it; payload returned
```

### Race catalog

The complete list. Each row names the two legal histories and the jobs that force them. Tier C (section 19) tests both orders of every row.

| # | race | histories | mechanism |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `prompt()` vs `prompt()` | one accepted; other `busy`, no write | acceptance job |
| 2 | `steer`/`followUp` vs run finish | consumed at a checkpoint · `NoActiveRun` | queue acceptance + `tryFinishRun` |
| 3 | deferred write vs run finish | applied before close · idle direct append | write acceptance + `tryFinishRun` |
| 4 | abort vs run finish | reconciliation, outcome `aborted` · `NoActiveOperation` | abort job + `tryFinishRun` |
| 5 | abort vs queue consumption | entry appended, not in abort payload · returned by abort, skipped | `consumeQueueItem` + abort drain |
| 6 | abort vs `before_run_end` follow-up | committed then drained by abort · dropped, nothing behind the marker | `commitRunEndFollowUp` |
| 7 | `nextRun` vs acceptance | captured by this run · belongs to the next | capture inside acceptance |
| 8 | deferred write vs abort close | applied during reconciliation · applied before it | `finishOperation("aborted")` loops |
| 9 | config/tree write vs acceptance snapshot | committed before the run's first request · deferred write | both are line jobs; snapshots read after acceptance |
| 10 | abort vs in-flight provider/tool effect | effect settles · effect interrupted | irreducible: signal cancellation; only the procedure commits results (abort path owns synthetics) |
| 11 | cross-lane writes | any interleaving | storage `seq` linearization (section 13); lanes share no state |
| 12 | `cancelQueued` vs consumption | consumed first: `already_consumed` · cancelled first: consumption skips, the model never sees it | cancel job + `consumeQueueItem` |

Row 10 is the one race no ordering can remove: an external effect may have happened even though its result never arrived. The design's answer is the section 5 intent record plus the replay policy — the same answer as for a crash.

### Drive modes

`drive: "automatic"` passes `fx` through; zero overhead. `drive: "manual"` wraps the operation's `fx` in a gate: every method call parks before executing and surfaces a JSON-safe description.

```ts
type ActionInfo =
  | { kind: "append_entry";  entryType: Entry["type"]; entryId: string }
  | { kind: "append_record"; recordType: LaneRecord["type"] }
  | { kind: "move_lane"; to: string | null }
  | { kind: "set_fact"; fact: "name" | "label" }
  | { kind: "try_finish_run"; outcome: "completed" | "failed" }
  | { kind: "finish_operation"; outcome: "completed" | "declined" | "failed" | "aborted" }
  | { kind: "commit_follow_up" }
  | { kind: "consume_queue_item"; queue: "steer" | "followUp"; entryId: string }
  | { kind: "apply_pending_write"; entryId: string }
  | { kind: "stream_assistant"; step: "assistant" | "compaction" | "branch_summary"; attempt: number }
  | { kind: "execute_tool"; toolCallId: string; toolName: string }
  | { kind: "fetch_deferred" | "cancel_deferred"; provider: string; id: string }
  | { kind: "hook"; name: HookName }
  | { kind: "sleep"; delayMs: number };
```

```ts
class GatedEffects implements Effects {
  private readonly queue: { info: ActionInfo; release: () => Promise<void> }[] = [];

  private gate<T>(info: ActionInfo, run: () => Promise<T>): Promise<T> {
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
      this.queue.push({
        info,
        release: async () => { await run().then(resolve, reject); },
      });
      this.arrived();          // wakes a pending driver
    });
  }

  appendRecord(record: NewRecord, telemetryContext: TelemetryContext) {
    return this.gate({ kind: "append_record", recordType: record.type },
                     () => this.inner.appendRecord(record, telemetryContext));
  }
  // ... one wrapper per method
}
```

The public controls, on the lane (section 8):

- `peekAction()` resolves with the description of the next parked call, or `undefined` when no operation exists or the operation has settled. No side effect; calling it twice returns the same action.
- `executeAction()` releases exactly the parked call `peekAction()` describes. It then waits until that call settles, the operation settles, or the released call parks a nested action; it returns the next parked action or `undefined`. It never releases two actions.
- `runToCompletion()` releases until the operation settles.
- Two concurrent drivers are a programmer defect, as is calling the controls in automatic mode.

Semantics that make tests deterministic:

- The gate is reentrant. A released action may call another `fx` method — notably `transform_context`, `before_payload`, and `after_response` hooks reached inside `stream_assistant`. The nested call parks as its own action. The driver observes and releases it before the outer action can continue; it never waits for the outer action while hiding the nested park. Every hook therefore remains an independent crash boundary without deadlocking manual drive.
- The gate serializes. Parallel tool batches issue phase-2 calls in source order (phase 1 is sequential, section 14); the gate parks them as separate `execute_tool` actions and manual mode runs them one at a time. Parallelism is a production optimization; source-ordered finalization already fixes the semantics, so automatic and manual modes produce the same durable log.
- The lane surface stays ungated. While the procedure is parked, a test calls `steer()`, `abort()`, `session.appendMessage()` — their jobs run on the mutation line immediately. Both orders of every race-catalog row are constructed by choosing whether to call the surface method before or after `executeAction()`.
- `close()` while parked: every parked call rejects with `HarnessClosed`, the local operation promise rejects, nothing else commits. The durable state is exactly the prefix of released effects — the definition of a crash site. Reopen the backend and `resume()` runs ordinary section 7 recovery. In automatic mode `close()` signals the in-flight effect, waits for the append in progress, and releases the writer claim; open operations stay resumable either way.

```ts
interface EffectiveLaneConfiguration {
  model: { provider: string; modelId: string };
  thinkingLevel: ThinkingLevel;
  activeToolNames: string[];
}

interface TerminalFailureState {
  entryId: string;
  source: "step" | "deferred_fetch";
  message: AssistantMessage;
}

/** In-memory orchestration state per lane. Always equal to the laneState
    produced by reducing the lane's records and own entries (section 7): live
    commits update it; restore recomputes it. */
interface LaneState {
  lane: string;
  leafId: string | null;
  operation: null | {
    id: string;
    kind: "run" | "compaction" | "navigation";
    intent: OperationStartedRecord["intent"];
    aborting: boolean;
    step: null | {                          // unfinished step: newest attempt's result entry missing
      kind: "assistant" | "compaction" | "branch_summary";
      attempts: number;
      resultEntryId: string;                // the newest attempt's provisioned result
      compactionReason?: "manual" | "threshold" | "overflow";
    };
    toolBatch: null | ToolBatchState;
    missingInitialMessages: ProvisionedEntry[];
    pendingSteer: ProvisionedEntry[];
    pendingFollowUp: ProvisionedEntry[];
    pendingWrites: ProvisionedEntry[];
    deferred: DeferredHandle | null;        // unredeemed handle
    overflowRecoveryUsed: boolean;          // section 6 overflow guard, from the reduction
    /** Newest entry this operation appended; pure predicates read it. */
    newestOwn: null | { entryId: string; type: Entry["type"];
                        role?: AgentMessage["role"]; stopReason?: TerminalStopReason };
    targets: { result?: boolean; summary?: boolean };   // structural ops
  };
  pendingNextRun: ProvisionedEntry[];
}

interface ToolBatchState {
  assistantEntryId: string;
  calls: {                                  // original source order and ordinals
    toolIndex: number;
    toolCall: AgentToolCall;
    started?: ToolStartedRecord;
    resultExists: boolean;
    terminate?: boolean;                    // persisted on the result entry
  }[];
  truncated: boolean;                       // assistant stopReason was "length"
  unresolved: boolean;
}

interface LaneReductionInput extends RecordLogSlice {
  leafId: string | null;
  /** Entries appended by the open operation, oldest first. Empty when idle. */
  ownEntries: readonly Entry[];
  /** Bounded effective-state lookups at the operation anchor or idle leaf,
      oldest first. */
  configurationEntries: readonly Entry[];
  /** Harness option fallbacks used when no persisted value exists. */
  defaults: EffectiveLaneConfiguration;
}

interface LaneReductionResult {
  laneState: LaneState;
  effectiveConfiguration: EffectiveLaneConfiguration;
  /** Non-null only when newestOwn is an error produced by a step or deferred fetch,
      never for an arbitrary error-shaped deferred write. */
  terminalFailure: TerminalFailureState | null;
}

function reduceLaneState(input: LaneReductionInput): LaneReductionResult;
```

Four control-flow signals travel by exception inside a procedure; none escapes to a caller. `RunFailed` carries a terminal failure into the drain-and-finish path. `Park` unwinds when a deferred handle was persisted; the lane suspends. `Aborted` unwinds to the abort path. `Overflow` routes a discarded recoverable response (section 6) into the compact-and-retry path. Any other rejection faults the harness.

```ts
class RunFailed { constructor(readonly error: OperationError) {} }
class Park      { constructor(readonly handle: DeferredHandle) {} }
class Aborted   {}
class Overflow  {}   // recoverable response discarded; its cost is already in the ledger

const newId = (): string => session.idGenerator.next();

/** Recovery-safe re-entry everywhere: skip a provisioned id that already
    exists (verify equal content; different content is corruption). */
async function appendIfMissing(target: ProvisionedEntry): Promise<void> {
  if (!(await session.getEntry(target.id))) await fx.appendEntry(target);
}
```

### Dispatch

```ts
async function resume(): Promise<ResumeResult> {
  if (missing.tools.length || missing.models.length) {
    return Result.err(new MissingIdentities({ lane: state.lane, ...missing,
                                              message: "Missing tools or models" }));
  }
  await fx.runHook("before_resume", beforeResumeEvent(state));  // per registration id (section 11)
  emit({ type: "run_resume", runId: op.id, recovery: true });
  // tagResume re-tags an operation Result as a ResumeResult: Ok gains
  // { operation }, Err passes through unchanged.
  switch (op.kind) {
    case "run":        return tagResume("run",        await runProcedure());
    case "compaction": return tagResume("compaction", await compactionProcedure());
    case "navigation": return tagResume("navigation", await navigationProcedure());
  }
}

async function runProcedure(): Promise<RunResult> {
  try {
    for (const m of [...op.missingInitialMessages]) await appendIfMissing(m);  // never dropped
    if (op.aborting) return await abortPath();

    if (op.deferred) {
      const redeemed = await redeemDeferred();               // may throw Park, RunFailed, Aborted
      if (hasToolCalls(redeemed)) await runToolBatch(redeemed);
    }
    if (op.toolBatch?.unresolved) await reconcileToolBatch(op.toolBatch);

    // A crash mid-step resumes that exact step before new checkpoint input
    // is consumed (section 7). Live retry and recovery consume identically.
    if (op.step?.kind === "assistant") {
      const outcome = await runTurn();
      if (outcome) return outcome;
    } else if (op.step?.kind === "compaction") {
      await autoCompact(requireAutoReason(op.step));         // recorded reason
    } else if (op.step) {
      throw new Error("Run has a branch-summary step");      // corruption
    }

    if (newestOwnMessageIsStepError(state)) {                // terminal-failure marker (section 7)
      return await handleRunFailed(existingFailure(state));
    }
    return await driverLoop();
  } catch (e) {
    return await handleRunSignal(e);
  }
}

async function handleRunSignal(e: unknown): Promise<RunResult> {
  if (e instanceof Park)      return suspended(e.handle);    // discard procedure; lane parked
  if (e instanceof Aborted)   return await abortPath();
  if (e instanceof RunFailed) return await handleRunFailed(e.error);
  throw e;                                                   // storage/defect → faulted harness
}
```


**Fixed-point self-check.** When `resume()` completes, parks, or closes its operation, the harness recomputes the section 7 reduction from storage and compares its `laneState` to the live `LaneState`. A mismatch is corruption and faults the harness — writer/reducer drift is caught the moment it happens instead of one crash later. The check is cheap (the same two bounded reads restore performs) and runs in production, not only under test.

### The loop

```ts
async function driverLoop(): Promise<RunResult> {
  while (true) {
    // checkpoint — each consumption is a conditional mutation-line job
    for (const w of [...op.pendingWrites])            await fx.applyPendingWrite(op.id, w.id);
    for (const m of steeringForThisCheckpoint(op))    await fx.consumeQueueItem(op.id, "steer", m.id);
    if (op.aborting) return await abortPath();
    if (await contextOverLimit()) await autoCompact(pressureReason());   // may throw RunFailed

    if (needsAssistant()) {
      const outcome = await runTurn();
      if (outcome) return outcome;
      continue;                                              // fresh checkpoint
    }

    for (const m of followUpsForThisCheckpoint(op))   await fx.consumeQueueItem(op.id, "followUp", m.id);
    if (needsAssistant() || hasPendingWork()) continue;

    // finish boundary
    const r = await fx.runHook("before_run_end", { runId: op.id, messages: runMessages() });
    if (r?.followUp) {
      await fx.commitRunEndFollowUp(op.id, provisionUserMessage(newId(), r.followUp));
    }
    if (hasPendingWork()) continue;

    const done = await fx.tryFinishRun(op.id, "completed");
    if (done === "finished") return finished("completed");
    // "continue": accepted input or abort won the ordering — loop
  }
}

async function runTurn(): Promise<RunResult | undefined> {
  let assistant: AssistantMessage;
  try {
    assistant = await assistantStep();          // may throw Park, RunFailed, Aborted, Overflow
  } catch (e) {
    if (e instanceof Overflow) return await recoverOverflow();
    throw e;
  }
  if (assistant.stopReason === "aborted" || op.aborting) return await abortPath();
  if (hasToolCalls(assistant)) await runToolBatch(assistant);
  return undefined;
}

async function recoverOverflow(): Promise<RunResult | undefined> {
  if (op.aborting) return await abortPath();
  if (op.overflowRecoveryUsed) {                // once per conversational input (section 6)
    await fx.appendEntry(giveUpAssistantEntry(lastAttemptResultId(op), state, truncationError()));
    return await handleRunFailed(truncationError());
  }
  await autoCompact("overflow");              // declined or nothing to compact → RunFailed
  return undefined;                             // driverLoop loops; needsAssistant is still true
}

async function handleRunFailed(error: OperationError): Promise<RunResult> {
  try {
    // Drain accepted input. No before_run_end, no further model work
    // unless consumed conversational input restarts the loop.
    while (true) {
      for (const w of [...op.pendingWrites]) await fx.applyPendingWrite(op.id, w.id);
      let consumed = 0;
      for (const m of steeringForThisCheckpoint(op)) {
        if (await fx.consumeQueueItem(op.id, "steer", m.id) === "consumed") consumed++;
      }
      if (consumed === 0) {
        for (const m of followUpsForThisCheckpoint(op)) {
          if (await fx.consumeQueueItem(op.id, "followUp", m.id) === "consumed") consumed++;
        }
      }
      if (op.aborting) return await abortPath();
      if (consumed > 0) return await driverLoop();           // input clears the failure
      const done = await fx.tryFinishRun(op.id, "failed", error);
      if (done === "finished") return finished("failed", error);
    }
  } catch (e) {
    return await handleRunSignal(e);
  }
}
```

`needsAssistant()`: the newest own message is a user, steering, follow-up, or tool-result message — except a completed tool batch in which every result persisted `terminate: true`, which does not by itself force another turn (section 4). `hasPendingWork()`: pending writes, pending queue items, or `needsAssistant()`.

### Steps

A failed attempt appends nothing. Besides the successful response, only a deferred handle, a terminal message, or the final give-up error enters the tree (section 6, retry trace).

```ts
async function assistantStep(): Promise<SettledAssistantMessage> {
  while (true) {
    if (op.aborting) throw new Aborted();
    const attempt = (op.step?.kind === "assistant" ? op.step.attempts : 0) + 1;
    if (attempt > retry.maxAttempts) {
      const error = retriesExhausted();
      // The give-up entry fulfills the last attempt's provisioned id.
      await fx.appendEntry(giveUpAssistantEntry(lastAttemptResultId(op), state, error));
      throw new RunFailed(error);
    }

    const options = await fx.runHook("before_request",
      { model: laneModel(state), step: "assistant", attempt, streamOptions });
    const resultEntryId = newId();
    await fx.appendRecord(stepAttempt(op.id, "assistant", attempt, resultEntryId));

    const final = await fx.streamAssistant(assistantRequest(state, options));
    await fx.appendRecord(usageRecord("assistant", op.id, resultEntryId, attempt, final));  // ledger, before any branch

    if (isRecoverableOverflow(final, state)) {
      throw new Overflow();                     // discarded; resultEntryId stays unfulfilled
    }
    if (final.stopReason === "deferred") {
      await fx.appendEntry(assistantEntry(resultEntryId, final));
      emit({ type: "run_suspend", runId: op.id, deferred: final.deferred });
      throw new Park(final.deferred);
    }
    if (final.stopReason === "error" && isRetryable(final)) {
      await fx.sleep(retryDelay(attempt));                   // retry events around this
      continue;                                              // durable count already advanced
    }

    await fx.appendEntry(assistantEntry(resultEntryId, final));
    if (final.stopReason === "error") throw new RunFailed(messageError(final));
    return final;                                            // stop, toolUse, genuine length, aborted
  }
}
```

`isRecoverableOverflow(final, state)` is `isContextOverflow(final)` — overflow-pattern errors and silent overflow — or `isRecoverableLength(final, desiredMaxOutput(state))` from section 6, where `desiredMaxOutput(state)` is the caller-supplied `maxTokens` when set, else the lane model's `maxTokens`. The check runs before the retryable-error branch: an overflow-form error compacts instead of retrying the same oversized request.

`summaryStep(step, reason, resultEntryId)` has the same shape: `step_attempt` before each attempt (`compactionReason` for compaction steps) carrying the step's single result id, `before_request`, one or two non-deferred requests — each followed by its `usage` record bound to that id — durable cap. It returns the summary value; the caller appends the result entry under that id. A hook-supplied summary makes no request and no request record; if it carries usage the hook measured itself, the appending procedure writes a `hook` usage record beside the entry. For reason `overflow` the appending procedure also writes the compaction `step_attempt`, so the once-per-input guard counts the recovery (section 6).

### Deferred redemption

```ts
async function redeemDeferred(): Promise<SettledAssistantMessage> {
  const final = await fx.fetchDeferred(deferredModel(state), op.deferred!);
  const resultEntryId = newId();
  if (final.stopReason !== "deferred" || hasReportedUsage(final)) {
    await fx.appendRecord(usageRecord("deferred_fetch", op.id, resultEntryId, 1, final));
  }
  if (op.aborting) throw new Aborted();
  if (final.stopReason === "deferred") {
    requireSameHandle(final.deferred, op.deferred!);           // mismatch is a defect (section 16)
    throw new Park(op.deferred!);                              // pending; no other write
  }
  if (final.stopReason === "aborted")  throw new Aborted();

  await fx.appendEntry(assistantEntry(resultEntryId, final));  // ready or terminal
  if (final.stopReason === "error") throw new RunFailed(messageError(final));
  return final;
}
```

One fetch per `resume()`. Pending re-parks without a write. A terminal answer — returned or converted from a rejected fetch — lands as the error entry and fails the run through the normal drain path, which still honors input accepted before the failure (section 6).

### Tools

The live path is section 14 `executeToolBatch`; the durability callbacks route through `fx`, so the gate and the traces see every write in order:

```ts
async function runToolBatch(assistant: AssistantMessage, telemetryContext: TelemetryContext): Promise<void> {
  const resultIds = new Map<string, string>();               // toolCallId → provisioned id

  await executeToolBatch(assistant, gatedActiveTools(), {
    beforeToolCall: async (call, args) => {
      return await fx.runHook("before_tool",
        { toolCallId: call.id, toolName: call.name, args });  // may patch args or block
    },
    onToolStart: async (call, effectiveArgs) => {
      const resultEntryId = newId();
      resultIds.set(call.id, resultEntryId);
      await fx.appendRecord(toolStarted(op.id, {
        assistantEntryId: newestAssistantEntryId(state),
        toolIndex: indexOf(assistant, call),
        toolCallId: call.id, toolName: call.name,
        effectiveArgs, resultEntryId,
        replay: declaredReplay(call),
      }));
    },
    afterToolCall: (call, args, result, isError) =>
      fx.runHook("after_tool", { toolCallId: call.id, toolName: call.name, args, ...result, isError }),
    onToolResult: async (message, terminate) => {
      // Blocked/invalid calls have no tool_started and no provisioned id;
      // their error result entry gets a fresh id (section 5).
      const entryId = resultIds.get(message.toolCallId) ?? newId();
      if (message.usage) {
        await fx.appendRecord(toolUsageRecord(op.id, entryId, message.toolCallId, message.usage));
      }
      await appendIfMissing(resultEntry(entryId, message, terminate));
    },
  }, { toolExecution: config.toolExecution }, emitLaneEvents, telemetryContext, abortSignal);
}
```

The recovery path handles each call at its crash site, in source order, keeping original ordinals:

```ts
async function reconcileToolBatch(batch: ToolBatchState, telemetryContext: TelemetryContext): Promise<void> {
  if (batch.truncated) {                                     // stopReason "length": never execute
    for (const call of batch.calls) {
      if (!call.resultExists) await appendIfMissing(truncatedToolResult(newId(), call.toolCall));
    }
    return;
  }

  for (const call of batch.calls) {
    if (call.resultExists) continue;

    if (call.started) {                                      // X3: effect outcome unknown
      if (call.started.replay === "safe" && currentDeclaration(call) === "safe") {
        const prepared = { kind: "prepared", toolCall: call.toolCall,
                           tool: toolByName(call.started.toolName),
                           args: call.started.effectiveArgs };   // persisted, not re-derived
        const executed  = await fx.executeTool(prepared);
        const finalized = await finalizeToolCall(prepared, executed,
          { afterToolCall }, telemetryContext, abortSignal); // fx-wired hook callback
        if (finalized.result.usage) {
          await fx.appendRecord(toolUsageRecord(op.id, call.started.resultEntryId,
            call.toolCall.id, finalized.result.usage));   // the replay's own record
        }
        await appendIfMissing(resultEntry(call.started.resultEntryId,
          createToolResultMessage(finalized), finalized.result.terminate === true));
      } else {
        await appendIfMissing(syntheticResult(call.started.resultEntryId, "interrupted"));
      }
    } else {                                                 // X1/X2: full path, original ordinal
      await runToolBatchForSingleCall(call);
    }
  }
}
```

### Abort

`abort()` itself is a lane-surface job (mutation line, above): marker, queue drain, signal, resolve. Reconciliation is procedure work. If the operation was suspended with no procedure running, `abort()` starts one at the abort path; manual mode leaves it parked at its first action.

```ts
async function abortPath(): Promise<RunResult> {
  if (op.deferred) await fx.cancelDeferred(deferredModel(state), op.deferred);  // best effort:
                                                             // rejection → telemetry, then proceed
  while (true) {
    for (const call of op.toolBatch?.calls ?? []) {
      if (call.resultExists) continue;
      await appendIfMissing(syntheticResult(idFor(call), call.started ? "interrupted" : "aborted"));
    }
    for (const w of [...op.pendingWrites]) await fx.applyPendingWrite(op.id, w.id);  // facts survive abort
    if (!newestOwnMessageIsAborted(state)) await appendIfMissing(abortClosureEntry(newId(), state));

    const done = await fx.finishOperation(op.id, "aborted");
    if (done === "finished") return finished("aborted");
    // "continue": a deferred write arrived meanwhile — apply it before closing
  }
}
```

### Structural operations

```ts
async function compactionProcedure(): Promise<CompactionResult> {
  try {
    if (op.aborting) return await abortStructural();
    if (!op.targets.result) {
      let result: CompactResult | undefined;
      if (!op.step) {          // no attempt yet: the decision hook may still run
        const hook = await fx.runHook("before_compaction",
          { reason: "manual", preparation: preparation(state),
            customInstructions: op.intent.customInstructions });
        if (hook?.decline) return await finishStructural("declined");
        result = hook?.compaction;
        if (result?.usage) {
          await fx.appendRecord(hookUsageRecord(op.id, op.intent.resultEntryId, result.usage));
        }
      }
      result ??= await summaryStep("compaction", "manual", op.intent.resultEntryId);
      await appendIfMissing(compactionEntry(op.intent.resultEntryId, result));
    }
    return await finishStructural("completed");
  } catch (e) { return await handleStructuralSignal(e); }
}

Hook-to-block wiring, in one table:

| harness hook | insertion point |
|---|---|
| `transform_context` | inside `fx.streamAssistant` (`StreamAssistantConfig.transformContext`) |
| `before_request` | before `fx.streamAssistant`, patches stream options |
| `before_payload` | inside the stream function, provider level |
| `after_response` | on the stream result, before the entry is appended |
| `before_tool` | `ToolCallbacks.beforeToolCall` (phase 1) |
| `after_tool` | `ToolCallbacks.afterToolCall` (phase 3) |
| `before_run_end` | `driverLoop` finish boundary; result committed via `fx.commitRunEndFollowUp` |
| `before_resume` | `resume()` dispatch, before any effect |
| — (record/entry writes) | `ToolCallbacks.onToolStart` / `onToolResult` via `fx` |

Notes:

- Auto-compaction inside a run runs under the run's own records; no nested operation.
- There is no "crashed mid-step" case in the code: an interrupted attempt is an attempt without a result entry, and the cap check decides retry versus `RunFailed`.
- Parallel batches and crash sites compose: `tool_started` records are written in source order during the sequential phase-1 pass, so a crash mid-batch leaves a source-order prefix of records — some with results, some without (section 6 table applies per call).
- An aborted assistant message (`stopReason: "aborted"`) skips tool execution; `abortPath()` owns the synthetic results.
- A crash between the navigation move and its summary entry loses the in-memory summary text; recovery regenerates it under the same attempt cap. A hook-supplied summary lost in that window is regenerated rather than re-asked: the hook's decline authority ended at the move.

## 16. pi-ai: deferred requests

Everything is per-request; batch APIs can implement the same shape through a custom provider.

```ts
// Request. Providers map this to their native mechanism, e.g.
// background: true on a Responses API, or a batch submission.
interface SimpleStreamOptions extends StreamOptions {
  deferred?: boolean | { window?: "15m" | "1h" | "24h" };
  // ... other options
}

// Response. A deferred request resolves quickly with a handle instead of
// content. The message is persisted like any assistant message; the handle
// is the durable fact recovery needs.
type StopReason = "pending" | "stop" | "length" | "toolUse" | "error" | "aborted" | "deferred";
// Agent-side settled-result narrowings.
type TerminalStopReason = Exclude<StopReason, "pending">;
type SettledAssistantMessage = AssistantMessage & { stopReason: TerminalStopReason };

interface DeferredHandle {
  provider: string;
  modelId: string;
  api: string;
  id: string;                    // provider token: response id, batch id + row
  expiresAt?: number;            // Unix ms
  pollAfterMs?: number;          // provider hint
  data?: JsonValue;              // provider conversion data
}

interface AssistantMessage {
  // ... other fields
  stopReason: StopReason;
  deferred?: DeferredHandle;     // present iff stopReason === "deferred"
}

// Authenticated HTTP request plumbing shared by stream, image, and deferred
// provider operations. Generation and streaming-transport controls are not
// part of this interface.
interface ProviderRequestOptions<TModel = Model<Api>> {
  signal?: AbortSignal;
  /** Explicit parent for this logical pi-ai operation. Inherited by stream,
      simple-stream, deferred fetch/cancel, and image options. */
  telemetryContext?: TelemetryContext;
  apiKey?: string;
  fetch?: FetchFunction;
  env?: ProviderEnv;
  onPayload?: (payload: unknown, model: TModel) =>
    unknown | undefined | Promise<unknown | undefined>;
  onResponse?: (response: ProviderResponse, model: TModel) => void | Promise<void>;
  headers?: ProviderHeaders;
  timeoutMs?: number;
  maxRetries?: number;
  maxRetryDelayMs?: number;
}

interface DeferredFetchOptions extends ProviderRequestOptions<Model<Api>> {
  /** Maximum provider long-poll duration. Omitted or zero checks once. */
  wait?: number;
}

type DeferredCancelOptions = ProviderRequestOptions<Model<Api>>;

// Redemption lives on the provider. The two methods are optional: their
// presence is the capability signal. A provider without them never returns
// stopReason "deferred" and ignores the deferred request option.
export interface ProviderStreams {
  stream(model: Model<Api>, context: Context, options?: StreamOptions): AssistantMessageEventStream;
  streamSimple(model: Model<Api>, context: Context, options?: SimpleStreamOptions): AssistantMessageEventStream;

  /** Redeem a handle. Same return type as streamSimple; downstream code is
      identical. Polls or re-attaches until terminal, then emits the normal
      events and final message. Resolution states, all in-band:
      - ready:          normal message (stop | toolUse | length)
      - still pending:  stopReason "deferred" with the same handle (after
                        `wait` expires; wait: 0 checks once)
      - terminal:       stopReason "error" (expired, unknown, consumed)     */
  fetchDeferred?(model: Model<Api>, handle: DeferredHandle,
                 options?: DeferredFetchOptions): AssistantMessageEventStream;

  /** Best effort; providers without cancellation omit it. */
  cancelDeferred?(model: Model<Api>, handle: DeferredHandle,
                  options?: DeferredCancelOptions): Promise<void>;
}
```

`ProviderRequestOptions.telemetryContext` is inherited by `StreamOptions`, `SimpleStreamOptions`, `DeferredFetchOptions`, `DeferredCancelOptions`, and `ImagesOptions`; provider, `Models`, `ImagesModels`, and direct stream/image dispatch preserve it unchanged. `buildBaseOptions()` also preserves it when built-in `streamSimple()` implementations convert to provider-specific stream options.

`pending` is internal to a mutable live-stream message. Request-wrapper results use `SettledAssistantMessage`; harness-written entries, durable usage records, and settled `pi.ai.request` spans cannot contain `pending`. Telemetry normalizes terminal `toolUse` to `tool_use`.

The harness uses the authenticated `Models` dispatch surface rather than talking to a provider object directly:

```ts
type ModelsDeferredFetchOptions = DeferredFetchOptions & ModelsRequestTransforms;
type ModelsDeferredCancelOptions = DeferredCancelOptions & ModelsRequestTransforms;

interface Models {
  // other methods
  fetchDeferred(model: Model<Api>, handle: DeferredHandle,
                options?: ModelsDeferredFetchOptions): Promise<AssistantMessage>;
  cancelDeferred(model: Model<Api>, handle: DeferredHandle,
                 options?: ModelsDeferredCancelOptions): Promise<void>;
}
```

`Models.fetchDeferred` and `Models.cancelDeferred` delegate to the provider methods with normal model resolution and authentication (credential store, expiring tokens, header merge). Their options carry the normal HTTP request settings, lifecycle callbacks, and model transforms; fetch options additionally carry the provider long-poll duration. A provider that returns `stopReason: "deferred"` must implement fetch; cancellation is best effort.

A terminal fetch answer is final for the run: the harness appends the error message and fails the operation, never starts an automatic replacement request, and converts a rejected fetch promise into the same `stopReason: "error"` message form so expected provider and authentication failures stay in-band. On a returned still-deferred message it requires the complete handle to equal the persisted handle: a provider cannot replace durable handle data without a write, so a mismatch is a defect.

Deferred assistant messages carry a handle, not content. Session context projection omits them from provider context; durable suspension and redemption use the persisted handle.

Stop-reason normalization is the adapter's job, and the harness branches only on the normalized value. For OpenAI Responses: `incomplete_details.reason === "max_output_tokens"` maps to `stopReason: "length"`; `content_filter` maps to a non-retryable `stopReason: "error"`. Adapters may retain the provider's reason as `rawStopReason` for diagnostics; core logic never reads it.

## 17. Forks and subagents

One copy primitive on the session repository:

```ts
type ForkOptions =
  | { scope?: "branch"; entryId?: string; position?: "before" | "at" }  // one path, root to fork point
  | { scope: "tree" };                                                  // all entries, every branch

repo.fork(source, options & { id?, parentSessionId? }): Promise<Session>;
repo.create({ id?, parentSessionId? }): Promise<Session>;
```

- Entries only. JSONL copies them without `lane`, then writes the final lane pointers. No records, no queues: a fork starts idle, every lane question answers "no open operation". No records also means no ledger: a fork's token and cost statistics start at zero — cost belongs to the session that incurred it; entry usage snapshots still display. Its `messageCount` is initialized from all copied message entries.
- Lanes: `scope: "branch"` → the fork has only `main`, at the fork point. `scope: "tree"` → every lane name and leaf pointer is copied. No operation logs or queues are copied either way, so every forked lane is idle.
- Facts: `scope: "tree"` copies all; `scope: "branch"` copies the name always, labels only when their target entry was copied.
- The fork point may be any message entry. A copy whose tip sits mid-tool-batch is still promptable: pi-ai's transformMessages inserts synthetic empty results for orphaned tool calls at request build time.
- The source is untouched; copying while it runs reads the committed prefix.
- Linkage is `parentSessionId`, set by `fork()` and settable on `create()` — the basis for subagent parent/child tracking and export bundles.
- A subagent tool derives its child session id deterministically from its invocation (`f(parentSessionId, toolCallId)`): a safe replay reattaches to the same child instead of spawning a twin, and the child stays discoverable from the parent even when a crash swallowed the tool result.
- Policy, restated from Part I: a platform thread that shares history with its channel is a lane; a fork is for isolation — subagents, exports, clones. A subagent can also run on a lane of its parent's session when isolation is not wanted.

## 18. Telemetry

Telemetry uses explicit context propagation. Core code does not use `AsyncLocalStorage`, global current-span state, or runtime-specific context APIs: pi runs in Node, Bun, browsers, and workers, so no runtime's ambient-context mechanism can be the core abstraction. An adapter may use ambient context internally — for example, an OpenTelemetry adapter may activate its native child context so HTTP auto-instrumentation attaches correctly — but pi always passes the parent explicitly.

Pi ships no exporter and requires no backend-specific telemetry implementation. It does ship `InMemoryTelemetryContext` as the deterministic backend-neutral reference implementation; applications may use it for process-local capture or supply a `TelemetryContext` adapter that bridges spans into OTel, Sentry, logs, or another backend. The adapter is trusted to obey the callback contract below. It owns backend ids and native context objects; core never carries trace-id plumbing.

### Package ownership

The generic contract, schema-definition machinery, shared no-op, and in-memory reference implementation live under `packages/telemetry/src/` and are exported from `@earendil-works/pi-telemetry`. The runner-independent conformance cases live under `packages/telemetry/src/testing/` and are exported from `@earendil-works/pi-telemetry/testing`. Pi-ai imports only `TelemetryContext` for request options; it owns no span schema or helper and emits no telemetry itself. `packages/agent/src/harness/telemetry.ts` owns both `AI_TELEMETRY_SCHEMA` / `startAiSpan()` and `HARNESS_TELEMETRY_SCHEMA` / `startHarnessSpan()`, plus the readonly `AGENT_TELEMETRY_SCHEMAS` tuple that composes their typed vocabularies without merging their schema data or versions. The agent package root re-exports those domain schemas, helpers, tuple, and the generic telemetry surface. There is one generic contract and one domain-schema owner.

`AgentHarnessOptions.telemetryContext` defaults to the no-op context, and the agent-side request wrapper emits `pi.ai.request` through the agent-owned AI schema.

Both schemas are pi-owned. Span names use the `pi.ai.*`, `pi.harness.*`, and `pi.session.*` families; attributes use the same pi-owned `pi.*` vocabulary and do not adopt an external semantic-convention namespace. Adapters translate them when useful; the emitted pi vocabulary remains stable regardless of backend convention churn.

### Context contract

```ts
type AttributeValue =
  | string
  | number
  | boolean
  | readonly string[]
  | readonly number[]
  | readonly boolean[];

interface SpanAttributes {
  [name: string]: AttributeValue | undefined;
}

interface SpanOptions {
  name: string;
  attributes?: SpanAttributes;
}

type SpanStatus =
  | { status: "ok" }
  | { status: "error"; error?: { name: string; message: string } };

interface TelemetryContext {
  startSpan<T>(
    options: SpanOptions,
    callback: (span: TelemetrySpan) => T | Promise<T>,
  ): Promise<T>;
}

interface TelemetrySpan extends TelemetryContext {
  addEvent(name: string, attributes?: SpanAttributes): void;
  setAttributes(attributes: SpanAttributes): void;
  setStatus(status: SpanStatus): void;
}
```

The telemetry package exports the shared no-op context and the deterministic in-memory reference context. The harness and compatibility wrapper select the no-op when no application context is supplied. Under the context contract, `startSpan()` creates the child and invokes its callback synchronously, exactly once, before returning a promise. It keeps the span open until the callback's value or promise settles:

- return or resolve: default status `ok`, then automatic end;
- synchronous throw: return a promise rejected with the same thrown value, after automatic error status and end;
- asynchronous rejection: automatic error status and end, then rejection with the same value;
- expected failure represented by a value: the callback calls `setStatus({ status: "error", ... })` before returning;
- repeated `setStatus()` calls are last-write-wins; automatic completion never overwrites an explicit status;
- `setAttributes()` merges keys; a later defined value overwrites an earlier one and `undefined` is ignored;
- calls on a settled span are inert and never throw.

Adapters preserve the callback's result and error. Their recording methods are synchronous, passive, and must not throw; asynchronous exporters buffer internally and flush on their own schedule. If native span creation or recording fails, the adapter suppresses that failure, ignores the failed recording call atomically, substitutes no-op behavior, and still invokes the business callback exactly once. A nonconforming adapter is an application defect. The no-op implementation invokes the callback with one shared inert span, allocates no per-span object, inspects and retains no attributes, and otherwise preserves the callback's behavior. Flushing a real adapter at shutdown is the application's responsibility.

The harness runtime passes context to every effectful implementation boundary as a normal argument. No core function looks up a current context:

```ts
streamAssistant(messages, configWithTelemetryContext, emit);
prepareToolCall(call, tools, callbacks, telemetryContext, signal);
executeToolCall(prepared, emit, telemetryContext, signal);
finalizeToolCall(prepared, executed, callbacks, telemetryContext, signal);
fx.appendEntry(entry, telemetryContext);
fx.runHook(name, event, telemetryContext);
```

A `TelemetrySpan` is also the explicit child `TelemetryContext`. Passing the callback span to lower-level work creates nesting through the ordinary call graph. The schema-typed API below automates that handoff by giving each callback a child starter bound to its live span; it does not use ambient mutable context. Every `Effects` method receives its parent as a parameter, and parallel tools use separate child spans and therefore separate parent contexts.

### Typed schema

The low-level adapter accepts the open `SpanAttributes` bag. Pi instrumentation never constructs untyped span names or attribute bags directly. The agent package exports the two plain, serializable domain schema objects and their typed helpers for that purpose.

```ts
type TelemetryAttributeType =
  | "string"
  | "number"
  | "boolean"
  | "string[]"
  | "number[]"
  | "boolean[]";

interface TelemetryAttributeMetadata {
  description: string;
  sensitive?: boolean;
  cardinality?: "low" | "high";
}

type TelemetryAttributeDefinition = TelemetryAttributeMetadata & (
  | { type: "string"; values?: readonly string[]; examples?: readonly string[] }
  | { type: "number"; values?: readonly number[]; examples?: readonly number[] }
  | { type: "boolean"; values?: readonly boolean[]; examples?: readonly boolean[] }
  | { type: "string[]"; elementValues?: readonly string[]; examples?: readonly (readonly string[])[] }
  | { type: "number[]"; elementValues?: readonly number[]; examples?: readonly (readonly number[])[] }
  | { type: "boolean[]"; elementValues?: readonly boolean[]; examples?: readonly (readonly boolean[])[] }
);

type TelemetryStartAttributeDefinition = TelemetryAttributeDefinition & { required: boolean };
type TelemetryEventAttributeDefinition = TelemetryAttributeDefinition & { required: boolean };

interface TelemetryEventDefinition {
  description: string;
  attributes: Record<string, TelemetryEventAttributeDefinition>;
}

type TelemetryParentDefinition =
  | { kind: "any" }
  | { kind: "root_or_external" }
  | { kind: "spans"; spans: readonly string[] };

interface TelemetrySpanDefinition {
  description: string;
  /** Exhaustive allowed-parent rule. "external" means a caller-owned span
      outside the pi schemas. */
  parents: TelemetryParentDefinition;
  startAttributes: Record<string, TelemetryStartAttributeDefinition>;
  /** Completion enrichment only. Every end attribute is optional; startSpan()
      owns ending the span regardless of which attributes were set. */
  endAttributes: Record<string, TelemetryAttributeDefinition>;
  events?: Record<string, TelemetryEventDefinition>;
  status: { default: "ok"; errorWhen: string };
}

interface TelemetrySchemaDefinition {
  version: number;
  spans: Record<string, TelemetrySpanDefinition>;
}

declare function defineTelemetrySchema<const T extends TelemetrySchemaDefinition>(schema: T): T;
```

`defineTelemetrySchema()` is a typed identity helper; the returned value is ordinary serializable data, not a validation runtime. Span names, attribute types, required keys, and literal `values` are inferred from that value. The tables below are the normative domain vocabulary; `packages/agent/docs/telemetry-schema.md` is its generated reference.

`createTypedSpanStarter(context, schemas)` binds one explicit parent context to the combined span vocabulary of a non-empty readonly schema tuple. The schemas retain independent objects, ownership, documentation, and versions; the tuple is not a third merged schema. Span names must be unique across the tuple and duplicate literal names fail compilation. The schema values are otherwise type-inference inputs only and are not inspected or retained at runtime.

The returned `TypedSpanStarter` is a per-name overload set that accepts only a declared literal name and that span's exact start attributes. A union-valued name must be narrowed before the call so its runtime name cannot be paired with another span's attributes. Its callback receives the schema-scoped span plus another starter over the same schema tuple bound to the callback span. The child starter therefore creates correctly nested spans without ambient context or manual rebinding, and concurrent callbacks receive independent starters:

```ts
const AGENT_TELEMETRY_SCHEMAS = [
  AI_TELEMETRY_SCHEMA,
  HARNESS_TELEMETRY_SCHEMA,
] as const;

const startSpan = createTypedSpanStarter(
  telemetryContext,
  AGENT_TELEMETRY_SCHEMAS,
);

await startSpan("pi.harness.step", stepAttributes, async (stepSpan, startChildSpan) => {
  stepSpan.setAttributes({ "pi.step.outcome": "succeeded" });
  return startChildSpan("pi.ai.request", requestAttributes, async (requestSpan) => {
    requestSpan.setAttributes({ "pi.ai.response.stop_reason": "stop" });
  });
});
```

The callback span still retains the open generic `TelemetryContext.startSpan()` method, so it can be passed to a starter for a different schema tuple when an integration intentionally crosses vocabularies. `createTypedSpanStarter()` itself adds no runtime span, schema validation, parent-rule enforcement, or durable state.

The following tables are normative input to the schema objects. `!` means a required start attribute; `?` means an optional start attribute. Every end attribute is optional enrichment. Array element sets use `elementValues`; all other closed sets use `values`. The automatic throw/reject rule from the context contract applies to every span in addition to the explicit status rule shown.

#### AI request schema

`AI_TELEMETRY_SCHEMA` declares no pi-written span events and one span. Its parent rule is `{ kind: "any" }`:

| span | allowed parents | status |
|---|---|---|
| `pi.ai.request` | root or any caller span | error on throw/reject or a returned result with stop reason `error`; `aborted` and `deferred` are normal outcomes |

| `pi.ai.request` start attribute | type | requirement | values / meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `pi.ai.operation` | string | ! | `stream`, `fetch_deferred`, `cancel_deferred`, `generate_images` |
| `pi.ai.provider` | string | ! | selected provider id |
| `pi.ai.model` | string | ! | requested model id |
| `pi.ai.api` | string | ! | provider API id |
| `pi.ai.streaming` | boolean | ! | whether this operation returns a stream |
| `pi.ai.deferred` | boolean | ? | whether the operation requests or participates in deferred execution |

| `pi.ai.request` end attribute | type | values / meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `pi.ai.response.model` | string | concrete response model, when reported |
| `pi.ai.response.id` | string | provider response id; high cardinality |
| `pi.ai.response.stop_reason` | string | `stop`, `length`, `tool_use`, `error`, `aborted`, `deferred`; terminal `toolUse` normalizes to `tool_use`, and `pending` is never recorded |
| `pi.ai.http.status_code` | number | final HTTP status when exposed by the provider path |
| `pi.ai.usage.input_tokens` | number | reported input tokens |
| `pi.ai.usage.output_tokens` | number | reported output tokens |
| `pi.ai.usage.cache_read_tokens` | number | reported cache-read tokens |
| `pi.ai.usage.cache_write_tokens` | number | reported cache-write tokens |
| `pi.ai.usage.reasoning_tokens` | number | reported reasoning subset of output |
| `pi.ai.usage.total_tokens` | number | reported total tokens |
| `pi.ai.usage.cost` | number | reported total cost |
| `pi.ai.stream.chunk_count` | number | number of streamed update chunks, without chunk content |
| `pi.ai.stream.time_to_first_chunk_ms` | number | elapsed milliseconds to first update chunk |
| `pi.ai.error.type` | string | low-cardinality provider or transport error class |

The schema declares no per-chunk telemetry event. The assistant stream carries live deltas while telemetry records only aggregate chunk count and first-chunk latency. Default telemetry never contains request or response content.

#### Harness schema

The three operation spans share `pi.session.id` (string, required, high cardinality), `pi.lane.name` (string, required, high cardinality), `pi.operation.id` (string, required, high cardinality), and `pi.operation.recovery` (boolean, required). Each also requires `pi.operation.kind` with only the literal matching that span. Operation error status may add optional end attributes `pi.error.code` and `pi.error.type`, both low-cardinality strings; free-form error messages are status diagnostics, not schema attributes.

| span | allowed parents | start attributes | optional end attributes | explicit error status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `pi.harness.run` | root or application span | common operation attributes plus `pi.operation.kind`: `run` | `pi.operation.outcome`: `completed`, `aborted`, `failed`, `suspended` | outcome `failed` |
| `pi.harness.compaction` | root or application span | common operation attributes plus `pi.operation.kind`: `compaction` | `pi.operation.outcome`: `completed`, `declined`, `aborted`, `failed` | outcome `failed` |
| `pi.harness.navigation` | root or application span | common operation attributes plus `pi.operation.kind`: `navigation` | `pi.operation.outcome`: `completed`, `declined`, `aborted`, `failed` | outcome `failed` |
| `pi.harness.checkpoint` | `pi.harness.run` | `pi.lane.name`!, `pi.operation.id`!, `pi.checkpoint.kind`!: `normal`, `failure_drain`, `abort_reconcile` | none | only throw/reject |
| `pi.harness.turn` | `pi.harness.run` | `pi.lane.name`!, `pi.operation.id`!, `pi.turn.id`! string, high cardinality | none | only throw/reject |
| `pi.harness.step` | `pi.harness.turn`, `pi.harness.checkpoint`, `pi.harness.compaction`, or `pi.harness.navigation` | `pi.lane.name`!, `pi.operation.id`!, `pi.step.kind`!: `assistant`, `compaction`, `branch_summary`; `pi.step.attempt`! number; `pi.compaction.reason`?: `manual`, `threshold`, `overflow` | `pi.step.outcome`: `succeeded`, `retry`, `failed`, `aborted`, `deferred`, `overflow` | outcome `retry` or `failed` |
| `pi.harness.tool` | `pi.harness.turn` for live work or `pi.harness.run` for reconciliation | `pi.lane.name`!, `pi.operation.id`!, `pi.turn.id`? string high-cardinality, `pi.tool.name`! string, `pi.tool.call_id`! string high-cardinality, `pi.tool.replay`!: `never`, `safe`; `pi.tool.recovery`! boolean | `pi.tool.is_error` boolean for the raw phase-2 execution result | `pi.tool.is_error: true` |
| `pi.harness.hook` | root or the current harness/AI scope | `pi.lane.name`!, `pi.operation.id`? string high-cardinality, `pi.hook.name`! string with values from `HookName`, `pi.hook.registration_id`? string | `pi.hook.outcome`: `completed`, `skipped`, `blocked`, `failed` | handler throw, including fail-closed `before_tool` |
| `pi.harness.sleep` | `pi.harness.step` or `pi.harness.run` | `pi.operation.id`!, `pi.sleep.delay_ms`! number | `pi.sleep.outcome`: `elapsed`, `aborted` | only throw/reject |
| `pi.harness.event_handler` | root or the scope emitting the event | `pi.event.type`! low-cardinality string with the section 10 event discriminants, `pi.lane.name`? string high-cardinality | none | listener throw; the event system catches it after the span rejects |
| `pi.session.write` | root or the current harness scope | `pi.lane.name`!, `pi.operation.id`? string high-cardinality, `pi.session.mutation`!: `entry`, `record`, `lane`, `fact`; `pi.session.item_type`? string | `pi.session.seq` number when the committed API exposes it | storage rejection |

The parent column maps directly to `TelemetryParentDefinition`: “root or application span” is `root_or_external`; “root or the current scope” and “root or any caller span” are `any`; every finite pi span list uses `spans` with exactly those names. `pi.harness.tool` wraps phase 2 (`executeTool`) only and settles before `after_tool` finalization: `pi.tool.is_error` describes the raw execution result, there is no final `terminate` attribute, and blocked or invalid calls that never execute emit no tool span. Live execution supplies the active turn id and parents the span to `pi.harness.turn`; reconciliation has no durable turn id, omits it, and parents the span directly to the resumed `pi.harness.run` invocation. The `pi.hook.name` values array is exactly `before_run`, `before_resume`, `before_run_end`, `transform_context`, `before_request`, `before_payload`, `after_response`, `before_tool`, `after_tool`, `before_compaction`, and `before_navigation`. The `pi.event.type` values array contains every `type` discriminant in the section 10 catalog and no others. `pi.harness.hook` describes one registered handler invocation, so isolated handler failures have their own status without failing the enclosing run. `pi.harness.event_handler` does the same for passive listener failures. The harness schema declares no span events initially.

Dynamic identifiers and names are attributes, never span names. The schema definitions are the exhaustive vocabulary pi instrumentation may emit.

The agent package exports both schemas, `AGENT_TELEMETRY_SCHEMAS`, each span-name union, per-name start/end/combined attribute types, event types, discriminated span unions, and typed `startAiSpan()` / `startHarnessSpan()` helpers. The telemetry package exports `createTypedSpanStarter()` and `TypedSpanStarter`; callers can bind the agent tuple when one scope needs both AI-request and harness spans. Every typed starter or domain helper accepts only that span's start attributes; its callback receives a schema-scoped view of the live span whose `setAttributes()` accepts only that span's optional end attributes and whose `addEvent()` accepts only declared event names and attributes. Individual calls reject missing required attributes, duplicate composed span names, unknown attributes, type mismatches, and invalid closed-set values at compile time. TypeScript does not try to prove that any end setter ran; `startSpan()` always owns automatic settlement. The scoped view erases to the generic `TelemetrySpan`; production performs no schema validation.

The schema objects are also the documentation source. `packages/agent/scripts/generate-telemetry-docs.ts`, exposed through package scripts `generate-telemetry-docs` and `check:telemetry-docs`, generates the combined AI-request and harness reference at `packages/agent/docs/telemetry-schema.md`. The Markdown file is repository documentation, not an npm package file; published consumers import both serializable schema objects from the agent package root. Schema `version` starts at 1; package changelogs record compatible additions and breaking renames, removals, type changes, or meaning changes. Explicit migration metadata is added only if a real consumer needs automatic translation.

### Effects and nesting

Telemetry wrappers follow ownership of ordinary work. The procedure layer wraps orchestration scopes — operation invocation, checkpoint, turn, and retryable step — and passes each callback's `TelemetrySpan` as the parent parameter to work below it. `Effects` wraps the atomic effect it owns. Telemetry is not part of the gated action vocabulary and creates no durable crash boundary.

```ts
async function assistantAttempt(
  turnContext: TelemetryContext,
  attempt: number,
  resultEntryId: string,
): Promise<SettledAssistantMessage> {
  return startHarnessSpan(
    turnContext,
    "pi.harness.step",
    {
      "pi.lane.name": state.lane,
      "pi.operation.id": op.id,
      "pi.step.kind": "assistant",
      "pi.step.attempt": attempt,
    },
    async (stepContext) => {
      await fx.appendRecord(
        stepAttempt(op.id, "assistant", attempt, resultEntryId),
        stepContext,
      );
      const final = await fx.streamAssistant(assistantRequest(state), stepContext);
      await fx.appendRecord(
        usageRecord("assistant", op.id, resultEntryId, attempt, final),
        stepContext,
      );
      return final;
    },
  );
}
```

Section 14's `streamAssistant()` is the logical model-request wrapper. It starts `pi.ai.request` with `startAiSpan()`, passes that callback span as `ProviderRequestOptions.telemetryContext` through `Models`, records only schema-declared aggregate response fields, and returns the same assistant message. `Effects.executeTool()` similarly wraps only phase 2 in `pi.harness.tool`; hook and event runners follow the same explicit-parent pattern.

| owner / method | target telemetry |
|---|---|
| operation dispatcher | `pi.harness.run`, `pi.harness.compaction`, or `pi.harness.navigation` |
| checkpoint / turn / step procedure scopes | corresponding `pi.harness.*` scope span |
| `appendEntry`, `appendRecord`, `moveLane`, `setFact`, and a conditional commit that writes | `pi.session.write`; a conditional no-write result emits no write span |
| `streamAssistant`, `fetchDeferred`, `cancelDeferred` | `pi.ai.request` with the matching `pi.ai.operation` |
| `executeTool` | `pi.harness.tool` |
| `runHook` | one `pi.harness.hook` per registered handler |
| `sleep` | `pi.harness.sleep` |
| passive event delivery | one `pi.harness.event_handler` per listener |

A context object and adapter-native span are process-local capabilities. Neither is persisted in a record, entry, snapshot, event, or deferred handle.

### Span lifetime

One operation span wraps one admitted in-process invocation of operation work. An initial `prompt()` / `compact()` / `navigateTree()` starts its span only after its `operation_started` acceptance commit; an admission `Err` such as `LaneBusy`, `InvalidMessage`, `NothingToCompact`, or `UnknownTarget` emits no operation span. A `resume()` starts its wrapper only after lane reservation, identity checks, and the other expected rejection checks pass. Each successful resume admission gets another span with the same durable operation id and recovery `true`. Repeated deferred polling therefore produces repeated ordinary wrapper spans correlated by operation id — no extra public lifecycle concept or durable telemetry state.

- a returned `completed`, `declined`, `aborted`, or `suspended` result resolves normally; instrumentation may enrich the span with the matching allowed outcome;
- a returned `failed` result explicitly sets error status and still resolves normally as the public API requires; it may also enrich the span with outcome `failed`;
- `close()`, a harness fault, or an invariant defect rejects the callback and therefore ends the local span as an error automatically;
- actual process death runs no cleanup, so the backend may lose or retain an incomplete span; the next process simply creates a new span on `resume()`.

If an outcome attribute is set, run spans never use `declined`; that value exists only in the compaction and navigation schemas. Trace context is not durable. Persisting a backend-specific trace token would couple recovery data to one telemetry system. A serving layer may link a resumed span to an earlier trace when it has that information.

The span tree follows execution scopes:

```text
pi.harness.run
├─ pi.harness.checkpoint
│  └─ pi.harness.step          compaction, attempt
├─ pi.harness.turn
│  ├─ pi.harness.step          assistant, attempt
│  │  ├─ pi.ai.request         provider, model, stop reason
│  │  └─ pi.harness.sleep      retry delay
│  └─ pi.harness.tool          tool name, call id, replay
├─ pi.harness.hook
├─ pi.harness.event_handler
└─ pi.session.write            entry/record/lane/fact

pi.harness.compaction          manual operation
pi.harness.navigation
```

The procedure layer owns operation, checkpoint, turn, and step scopes. `Effects` owns session writes, phase-2 tool execution, hooks, and sleep. The request-dispatch wrapper around `Models` owns `pi.ai.request`; passive event delivery owns handler spans. Each owner receives its parent context explicitly.

### Safety and testing

Default attributes carry only schema-declared identifiers, names, counts, durations, stop reasons, status codes, and usage. They must never carry prompts, completions, tool arguments, tool output, file content, provider payloads, headers, or credentials. Schema fields flag any future sensitive or high-cardinality attribute explicitly.

Telemetry remains separate from events and hooks:

- Events are public live observation.
- Hooks can change execution.
- Telemetry is passive process-local diagnostics.

## 19. Testing strategy

Three tiers. Each tests a different claim; none replaces another.

### Tier A — reduction and resume

Prefill a session with the records and entries of one section 6 crash state through the public `Session` API (`appendRecord`, low-level `appendEntry`), open the harness, call `resume()`, assert the durable result.

```ts
await session.appendRecord(opStarted("run", { originalPrompt, initialMessages: [userEntry] }));
await session.appendEntry(userEntry, "main");
await session.appendRecord(stepAttempt("assistant", 1));
await session.appendEntry(assistantWithToolCall, "main");
await session.appendRecord(toolStarted({ replay: "safe", resultEntryId: "result-1" }));
// This durable prefix is X3.

const { harness, suspended } = await AgentHarness.create(options);
expect(suspended).toHaveLength(1);
expect((await harness.resume()).ok).toBe(true);
```

Coverage: every X1–X5 tool state, replay safe/never/changed declarations, every source-order position in a batch, truncated (`length`) batches proving no execution, abort before and after each durable point, the terminal-failure marker with and without later consumed input, missing initial messages, pending, cancelled, and abort-killed queue items, deferred writes, deferred handles (pending, ready, terminal, rejected fetch, mismatched handle, abort), unfinished steps resuming before new checkpoint input is consumed — including steering accepted during an interrupted retry — attempt caps across restart including auto-compaction exhaustion, every overflow crash site from the section 6 table, post-move navigation states from the section 6 table, section 5 validity rejections, and half-completed recovery (run the same prefix through recovery twice).

The in-memory backend is the reference. The parity suite runs the same setups against memory, JSONL, and SQLite; one case runs concurrent writes on two lanes and asserts unique increasing `seq` and identical `getLog()` order; another asserts every backend rejects the same non-JSON payloads.

### Tier B — writer conformance

Tier A assumes live execution writes the correct prefix; Tier B verifies it. Run the public harness against an instrumented `Session` recording every entry (`E`), record (`R`), lane move (`L`), fact (`G`), and hook (`H`). Assert exact order against the section 6 traces: one-tool run, retry, terminal failure, steering during a tool, queue cancellation, finish-boundary orders, deferred write mid-turn, abort during a tool, auto-compaction, context overflow (discard, guard, hook-supplied), manual compaction, navigation (move-first), deferred suspension and every fetch outcome. This tier catches the critical regression class: an effect starting before its intent record.

Tier B also asserts the append-only-context invariant (section 4) executably: within a run, every faux-provider request's message list extends the previous request's as an exact prefix — except across a compaction entry, the one sanctioned invalidation. This turns the KV-cache discipline from prose into a failing test whenever a write path inserts before the tail.

### Tier C — deterministic interleavings

`drive: "manual"` against the real `AgentHarness`, the faux provider, and a real backend. The gate is the only test hook; there is no second machine.

```ts
const { harness } = await AgentHarness.create({ session, models, model, tools: [calc], drive: "manual" });
const promptResult = harness.prompt("calculate");

while ((await harness.peekAction())?.kind !== "execute_tool") await harness.executeAction();

// X3: intent durable, effect not started
const started = await session.findRecords({ lane: "main", type: "tool_started" });
expect(await session.getEntry(started[0]!.resultEntryId)).toBeUndefined();

expect((await harness.steer("focus on tests")).ok).toBe(true);   // surface is ungated
await harness.runToCompletion();
expect((await promptResult).ok).toBe(true);
```

Crash simulation is `close()` at a chosen boundary, then reopening the same backend and resuming. Crash sites are derived mechanically, not hand-picked: drive each section 6 trace in manual mode, snapshot the backend after **every** `executeAction()`, then reopen every snapshot and `resume()` — and run recovery twice per snapshot, proving half-completed recovery is safe. New effects added to a trace get crash coverage automatically. Coverage: **both orders of every race-catalog row (section 15)**, input injected between arbitrary actions, abort while a cancellable effect is parked and while it runs, and automatic versus manual drive producing identical durable logs and outcomes for the same scripted provider.

Gate invariants, asserted across Tier C:

- After every `resume()` outcome, the recomputed reduction's `laneState` equals live `LaneState` (the section 15 fixed-point self-check fired and passed).
- `peekAction()` has no side effect and is stable until `executeAction()`.
- `executeAction()` releases exactly the peeked action, never a later one.
- Stopping before an action leaves exactly the preceding durable prefix.
- While parked, zero storage writes and zero provider or tool calls happen (construction rule, section 15).
- Every accepted operation gets exactly one `operation_finished` unless it suspends.
- A faulted append leaves a valid prefix and faults the whole harness.

### Other suites

- The telemetry reference adapter and every third-party adapter run the exported conformance cases for synchronous admission, result/rejection identity, automatic and explicit status, attribute merging, event order, post-settlement behavior, parentage, and unreadable-payload suppression.
- Runtime telemetry tests use the in-memory reference to assert exact schema-conforming span trees and independently valid start/end/event bags on every status path. End attributes remain optional. Content and secret fixtures assert absence, not merely redaction.
- The existing `agent-loop` and `agent` suites pass unchanged — the section 14 compatibility criterion.
- Event ordering per section 10, including `message_end` after commit.
- Hooks: registration-id `resumeData` round trips, duplicate-id rejection, aggregation order, fail-closed `before_tool`.
- Ledger completeness and the match invariant: every provider request leaves exactly one `usage` record per physical request (split-turn: two per attempt; a pending deferred fetch that reports no usage writes none); failed compaction series and discarded overflow responses lose no recorded cost; each usage-bearing entry's snapshot equals the newest non-adjustment record(s) bound to its id; a replayed tool records both executions; adjustments never alter entries and sum into read-time effective cost; `getStats()` token and cost fields equal the ledger sum and the `usage` event's totals after every commit; fork token and cost fields start at zero while `messageCount` includes all copied message entries; v3 conversion preserves totals through the aggregate import adjustment.
- Overflow classification against the reported provider shapes: prompt 268,009 of a 272,000 window and 81,217 of 84,500 (recoverable), non-zero reasoning-only output, cache-write-heavy usage, a Codex-style provider that rejects `max_output_tokens`, a genuine 1,024-token cap fully used (not recoverable), and `length → length` stopping after exactly one recovery per conversational input.
- v3 fixtures: labels, session info, and `leaf` entries mid-chain and at end of file, old `firstKeptEntryId` compactions — all open as one normalized idle `main` lane.

## 20. Implementation status and work packages

Work is limited to `packages/agent`, `packages/session-backends/sqlite-node`, `packages/telemetry`, and the telemetry request-option surface in `packages/ai`. Other package source is off limits. In particular, this plan does not migrate `packages/coding-agent`; I0's completed dependency wiring is the only exception. Coding-agent v3 compatibility means only that the new JSONL repository can read supported v3 sessions.

### Claiming and completing a package

1. Sync with `main`. A package is claimable only when its checkbox is empty, every dependency is checked, and no active reservation owns the package or overlapping primary files.
2. Add `**Reserved: <package-id> by @<username>.**` immediately above the package entry. Land that change alone with commit message `docs(agent): reserve <package-id>`. The package is claimed only after this commit reaches `main`; if another conflicting reservation lands first, remove yours and choose again.
3. Start from the reservation commit. Read the referenced design and primary files.
4. Work in this loop:
   1. Implement the package's described behavior within its primary files. Incomplete public operations keep rejecting with `HarnessNotImplemented`.
   2. Implement comprehensive focused tests that encode the package's acceptance criteria and every design invariant the package owns. Smoke tests and happy-path coverage alone are insufficient; each owned invariant must have an executable assertion.
   3. Iterate on the implementation and tests until the behavior is complete and all affected tests pass.
   4. If the design does not hold, stop and consult Mario on Discord. After agreement, update the design and package description, then return to step 1.
5. Run `npm run check`. The implementation PR or commit removes its reservation and changes the package checkbox to checked. If work is abandoned, remove the reservation without checking the package.

### Track F — scaffold truth and public ownership

- [x] **F0 — harden the scaffold.** Dependencies: none.
  - Primary files: `packages/agent/src/harness/agent-harness.ts`, `packages/agent/test/harness/agent-harness-scaffold.test.ts`.
  - Inventory every public method. Preserve only behavior that is genuinely correct without an operation runtime, such as immutable harness-global configuration copies and direct leaf reads. Make every other placeholder reject with `HarnessNotImplemented` instead of returning empty snapshots, idle state, or no-op drive/wait success.
  - Before R3, `AgentHarness.create()` may open only a record-free session. It rejects any session containing records rather than reporting a false empty suspended list.
  - Acceptance: a table-driven scaffold test covers every public method and proves no unfinished method reports plausible success.

### Public method ownership

This table is exhaustive. A package does not remove `HarnessNotImplemented` from a method until it owns the listed semantics and tests.

| public surface | owning package |
|---|---|
| scaffold-safe `name`, `getLeafId`, record-free create, runtime settings | F0 |
| `AgentHarness.create()` restore and `suspended` inventory | R3 |
| `lane`, `createLane`, `lanes`, lane facades, lane-bound session reads | H0 |
| resources, stream/retry/compaction settings, queue modes | F0 |
| tool registry plus persisted active-tool selection | H4 |
| `prompt`, `skill`, `promptFromTemplate` | H1 |
| run `resume`, retries, terminal failure | H2 |
| `steer`, `followUp`, `nextRun`, `cancelQueued` | H3 |
| persisted model/thinking/active-tools, lane-view writes, `recordUsage` | H4 |
| `abort`, `waitForIdle`, `runWhenIdle`, close settlement | H5 |
| live tools and tool events | H6 |
| tool recovery through `resume` | H7 |
| deferred-handle `resume` and cancellation | H8 |
| `compact` and compaction resume | C1–C3 |
| `navigateTree` and navigation resume | N1 |
| `peekAction`, `executeAction`, `runToCompletion` primitives/integration | I5/H0 |
| hooks/events registration primitives and harness wiring | I1/I2/H0 |
| `watch`, `watchSession`, complete snapshots | O1 |

### Track QA — legacy test salvage

Implementation packages derive their tests from this design and do not use the promotion test matrix. The QA track alone owns `packages/agent/docs/harness-v2-test-matrix.md`. Old tests are evidence, not specification: QA ports a case only when it still expresses a target-design invariant and comprehensive current coverage does not already exist.

- [x] **QA1 — inventory removed tests.** Dependencies: none.
  - Inventory the tests removed by the harness promotion and record whether each case is covered, inapplicable, or blocked on a new implementation package.
  - Acceptance: every removed case has a disposition in the matrix; no production or test code changes.

- [x] **QA2 — salvage storage and query tests.** Dependencies: QA1, R0.
  - Port worthwhile bounded-query, corruption, fork, immutable-read, lane, record-query, and recovery-query cases whose replacement APIs already exist. Skip deleted implementation details and behavior already covered by backend conformance.
  - Acceptance: each reviewed storage/query case is covered by a cited current test, ported as a comprehensive invariant test, marked inapplicable, or left blocked on J1–J5.

- [ ] **QA3 — salvage remaining legacy tests.** Dependencies: QA2, J5, O2.
  - After the new storage and harness runtime are complete, review every matrix case still blocked or uncovered. Port only still-valid invariants against the new public APIs; do not restore deleted APIs or old implementation details. QA3 may change focused tests and the matrix, but no production code.
  - Acceptance: every matrix row ends covered by a cited current test, ported by a comprehensive new test, or explicitly inapplicable; no row remains blocked or uncovered.

### Track R — recovery query, reducer, and restore

These packages merge R0 → R1 → R2 → R3. R1 and R2 add a reducer module instead of growing `agent-harness.ts`. R3 is the first package in this track that owns `agent-harness.ts` and therefore runs after F0.

- [x] **R0 — recovery-query contract.** Dependencies: none.
  - Primary files: `packages/agent/src/harness/session/types.ts`, `session.ts`, `memory.ts`, SQLite record storage/repository files, backend conformance, and focused recovery-query tests.
  - Add `RecordQuery.operationKind` and `findOpenOperations(lane, { limit })` exactly as specified in sections 7, 12, and 13. Memory maintains the projection, JSONL will derive it during replay, and SQLite answers it from the lane open-operation projection.
  - Prove that zero/one open operations are distinguishable, that normal writes cannot start a second operation on a busy lane, and that the latest run-kind start is an indexed query. Add the lane open-operation projection.
  - Acceptance: memory and SQLite have identical query behavior, invalid query combinations reject, and no restore algorithm needs a full historical scan.

- [x] **R1 — pure record-log validity.** Dependencies: R0.
  - Primary files: `packages/agent/src/harness/reducer.ts`, `packages/agent/test/harness/reducer.test.ts`.
  - Validate the section 5 corruption rules from discovered open starts, bounded records, and point-looked-up entries, with no writes or effects.
  - Acceptance: one focused rejection test per validity bullet, plus valid prefixes at every section 6 crash point.

- [x] **R2 — pure lane-state reduction.** Dependencies: R1.
  - Primary files: `packages/agent/src/harness/reducer.ts`, `packages/agent/test/harness/reducer.test.ts`.
  - Implement the section 15 `LaneReductionInput` → `LaneReductionResult` contract. Derive pending queues/writes, attempts, tool batches, deferred handles, structural targets, and idle next-run state into `laneState`; derive effective configuration and terminal-failure provenance beside it from the same section 7 query inputs.
  - Keep `LaneState` limited to orchestration state. Reduction exclusively owns all three outputs; later recovery packages consume `LaneReductionResult` and do not re-reduce tool or operation records.
  - Acceptance: table-driven tests cover idle and every suspended state, configuration fallback/override, and terminal-failure provenance; reduction is deterministic and performs no writes.

**Reserved: R3 by @vegarsti.**

- [ ] **R3 — harness restore inventory.** Dependencies: F0, R2.
  - Primary files: `packages/agent/src/harness/agent-harness.ts`, reducer integration helpers, and restore tests.
  - Wire `AgentHarness.create()` to use indexed open-operation discovery, bounded idle/open scans, explicit provisioned-id point lookups, and bounded configuration lookups. Return accurate `SuspendedOperation[]` without starting effects.
  - Acceptance: idle and multi-lane restore write nothing, multiple open operations reject as corruption, suspended metadata is complete, and one lane never scans another lane's traffic. `resume()` may still reject as unimplemented.

### Track J — JSONL storage

**In progress and reserved: @davidbrai.** The work began before this plan was split into J0–J5. Before merge, the track owner must include or rebase onto R0's recovery-query contract and report which J packages are complete. Other agents must not pick a J package while this ownership marker remains.

These packages own `packages/agent/src/harness/session/jsonl/**`, the concrete `JsonlSessionRepo` export, and `packages/agent/test/harness/session/jsonl*.test.ts`. They merge J0 → J1 → J2 → J3 → J4 → J5 and may proceed in parallel with tracks L and I after R0.

- [x] **J0 — JSONL metadata and codec contracts.** Dependencies: R0.
  - Primary files: JSONL type/codec modules and focused codec tests; no public repository export yet.
  - Implement the `JsonlSessionMetadata`, create/list options, format-4 header, line discriminants, `modifiedAt`, metadata, and parent-id/legacy-parent-path rules from section 13.
  - Acceptance: type and codec round trips cover every header field and line kind; no filesystem lifecycle yet.
- [x] **J1 — format-4 per-session storage.** Dependencies: J0.
  - Implement one-session replay/write support for entries, records, lanes, facts, statistics, branch queries, operation-kind queries, and open-operation projection.
  - Keep it internal; do not export a partially implemented repository.
  - Acceptance: focused round-trip tests cover every mutation, shared `seq`, query bounds, immutable reads, and JSON validation.
- [x] **J2 — format-4 repository lifecycle and forks.** Dependencies: J1.
  - Add create/open/list/delete, one writer queue per session, metadata ordering/filtering, branch/tree forks, and the concrete public `JsonlSessionRepo` export.
  - Acceptance: the complete backend-neutral conformance suite passes against JSONL, including concurrent lane writes and forks.
- [ ] **J3 — format-4 crash and corruption behavior.** Dependencies: J2.
  - Add torn-tail truncation, malformed-interior rejection, missing-reference rejection, and lifecycle/concurrency edge cases.
  - Acceptance: acknowledged writes survive reopen and malformed non-tail data is never silently repaired.
- [ ] **J4 — read-only v3 normalization.** Dependencies: J3.
  - Decode supported coding-agent v3 files into the normalized v4 logical tree: custom messages, labels, session info, leaf resolution, discarded-entry reparenting, old compactions, timestamps, parent mapping, and idle `main`.
  - A read-only open must not modify the physical file. No coding-agent source or test is changed.
  - Acceptance: fixture tests cover every normalization rule in section 12 and malformed v3 input.
- [ ] **J5 — first-write v3 conversion.** Dependencies: J4.
  - Rewrite through a temporary format-4 file on the first mutation, preserve metadata/facts/tree and resolved or legacy parent linkage, and add the aggregate v3 usage adjustment.
  - Acceptance: crash-safe conversion tests cover failure before rename, successful reopen, statistics preservation, unresolved legacy parent paths, and no second conversion.

### Track I — primitives

I0, I1, and I2 may proceed independently. I3 → I4 → I5 is serial and begins after R2 fixes the `LaneState` shape. These packages use separate modules with focused unit tests; I5 remains primitive-only and does not edit `agent-harness.ts`.

- [x] **I0 — telemetry contracts, typed schemas, and no-op context.** Dependencies: none.
  - Primary files: `packages/telemetry/src/index.ts`, `packages/telemetry/src/memory.ts`, `packages/telemetry/src/testing/`, and focused tests; pi-ai request-option types/propagation and focused tests; `packages/agent/src/harness/telemetry.ts`, `packages/agent/src/index.ts`, focused tests, package scripts, `packages/agent/scripts/generate-telemetry-docs.ts`, and generated `packages/agent/docs/telemetry-schema.md`. Do not edit `agent-harness.ts`; its canonical context type is landed, while H0 owns option renaming/defaulting/storage and execution threading after convergence.
  - In telemetry, implement the one canonical section 18 callback-based `TelemetryContext` / `TelemetrySpan` contract, shared no-op context, deterministic in-memory reference adapter, runner-independent adapter conformance cases, serializable `defineTelemetrySchema()` machinery, and `createTypedSpanStarter(context, schemas)` composition with child-bound starters.
  - In pi-ai, add optional `telemetryContext` to `ProviderRequestOptions` so every stream, deferred, and image option inherits it; provider, `Models`, `ImagesModels`, direct dispatch, and simple-option conversion preserve it. Pi-ai owns no domain schema or helper.
  - In agent, define the complete normative `AI_TELEMETRY_SCHEMA` and `HARNESS_TELEMETRY_SCHEMA`, their inferred types, the readonly `AGENT_TELEMETRY_SCHEMAS` composition tuple, and typed `startAiSpan()` / `startHarnessSpan()` helpers. Export both schemas, the tuple, and helpers, and re-export the generic telemetry surface from the agent package root. Do not duplicate the generic contract and do not adopt OTel or another external semantic convention.
  - Generate the combined repository-only Markdown reference from the runtime schema values with the named agent package scripts. Production helpers perform no runtime schema validation; schemas compile-time-check each pi-written start/end/event call and remain importable as machine-readable data.
  - Wire telemetry before pi-ai in workspace, local-release, publish, profiling, and coding-agent binary build order; add source-test aliases and refresh workspace/generated dependency locks.
  - Landed coverage: focused tests exercise no-op synchronous admission, returned-value and sync/async rejection preservation, explicit no-op child propagation, one shared frozen inert span with no payload inspection, exact start/optional-end inference, multi-schema vocabulary composition, child-starter parent propagation, rejection of duplicate span names and missing, unknown, empty-schema, and invalid closed-set attributes, absence of declared span events, schema JSON serialization, the in-memory reference against every exported adapter conformance case, option propagation across provider/`Models` stream and deferred dispatch, direct and `ImagesModels` image dispatch, built-in simple-option conversion, and generated-document freshness. O2 will use the reference adapter to test pi's runtime status and nesting behavior with captured spans.
- [ ] **I1 — hook registry and runner.** Dependencies: none.
  - Primary files: `packages/agent/src/harness/hooks.ts`, `packages/agent/test/harness/hooks.test.ts`.
  - Implement typed registration, stable-id validation, ordered aggregation, error isolation, fail-closed `before_tool`, and per-id resume data handling.
  - Acceptance: focused tests cover every section 11 aggregation and failure rule; no operation wiring yet.
- [ ] **I2 — passive events and watch buffering.** Dependencies: none.
  - Primary files: `packages/agent/src/harness/events.ts`, `packages/agent/test/harness/events.test.ts`.
  - Implement passive listener isolation and the snapshot/start/unsubscribe buffer primitive used by lane and session watchers.
  - Acceptance: no snapshot/event gap, ordered one-time flush, independent watchers, and `handler_error` recursion safety; no operation wiring yet.
- [ ] **I3 — lane mutation line.** Dependencies: R2.
  - Primary files: `packages/agent/src/harness/lane-runtime.ts`, focused mutation-line tests.
  - Implement the per-lane FIFO and state-update discipline with test-only jobs for every conditional history in section 15.
  - Acceptance: jobs never interleave, rejected jobs do not poison the queue, and no external effect runs inside a job.
- [ ] **I4 — automatic `Effects` implementation.** Dependencies: I0, I1, I3, L3.
  - Primary files: `packages/agent/src/harness/effects.ts`, focused effects tests.
  - Implement durable writes, conditional commits, provider/tool/hook adapters, sleep, fault propagation, and live-state updates behind the complete `Effects` interface.
  - Acceptance: every external effect and durable write crosses `Effects`, and a failed write faults the whole harness.
- [ ] **I5 — manual gate primitive.** Dependencies: I4.
  - Primary files: `packages/agent/src/harness/gated-effects.ts`, focused gate tests.
  - Implement `GatedEffects` action descriptions, stable peek, exactly-one release, reentrant nested actions, run-through, and parked rejection without wiring public lane controls yet.
  - Acceptance: zero effects while parked, nested hook actions surface without deadlocking their released parent, and durable-prefix close simulations pass at the primitive boundary.

### Track L — agent-loop building blocks

These packages all own `packages/agent/src/agent-loop.ts` and therefore merge strictly L1 → L2 → L3. Existing `agent-loop` and `agent` tests pass unchanged after each package.

**Reserved: L1 by @cristinaponcela.** Other agents must not pick L1 while this ownership marker remains.

- [ ] **L1 — extract assistant streaming.** Dependencies: I0.
  - Add `streamAssistant()` and `StreamAssistantConfig`, including explicit telemetry context; route the compatibility loop's request path through it without changing events or results.
  - Acceptance: focused stream tests cover settled-result narrowing (a final `pending` value is a defect), plus unchanged existing loop tests.
- [ ] **L2 — extract tool-call phases.** Dependencies: L1.
  - Add `prepareToolCall()`, `executeToolCall()`, `finalizeToolCall()`, result helpers, replay declaration, explicit telemetry contexts, and durability callbacks without changing batch behavior.
  - Acceptance: phase tests cover validation, blocking, abort, callback failure, updates, and patches.
- [ ] **L3 — compose tool batches and compatibility wrappers.** Dependencies: L2.
  - Add `executeToolBatch()` with sequential/parallel source ordering, truncation, abort, and `terminate` rules; make every legacy loop export a thin composition using the no-op context.
  - Acceptance: source-order and parallelism tests plus unchanged `agent-loop` and `agent` suites.

### Track H — harness integration and run execution

H0 converges restore and primitives into `agent-harness.ts`. H0–H8 then merge strictly in order. Each package adds its Tier A recovery cases, Tier B exact trace, relevant events/hooks, and Tier C interleavings rather than deferring testing to the end.

- [ ] **H0 — lane facades and primitive integration.** Dependencies: R3, I2, I5.
  - Wire durable lane lookup/creation/inventory, equivalent name-bound facades, canonical hook/event/telemetry types, rename `AgentHarnessOptions.context` to `telemetryContext` with the no-op default and stored root context, public manual-drive controls, and ownership/close plumbing.
  - Acceptance: repeated facades are equivalent, lanes remain isolated, public drive controls match gate actions, and no placeholder operation is accidentally enabled.
- [ ] **H1 — one successful no-tool run.** Dependencies: H0, L3, I1.
  - Implement `prompt`, skill/template expansion, run acceptance, capture of already-pending next-run items, initial appends, one assistant step, usage record, message commit, conditional finish, result, and basic run/turn/message events/hooks.
  - H3 later owns public next-run enqueue/cancel/race behavior; H1 owns capture into `operation_started.initialMessages`.
  - Acceptance: automatic/manual durable logs are identical; closing after every released action restores the expected suspended prefix.
- [ ] **H2 — retry, run resume, and terminal failure.** Dependencies: H1.
  - Add durable attempt counts, retry policy/backoff/events, unfinished-assistant resume, give-up error entries, terminal-failure drain, and fixed-point checks for these states.
  - Acceptance: retry caps survive reopen; failed attempts record usage but no message; half-completed recovery is idempotent.
- [ ] **H3 — queues and checkpoints.** Dependencies: H2.
  - Add next-run/steer/follow-up acceptance and modes, cancellation, checkpoint consumption, queue events, and finish-boundary conditionals. Consume the queue state produced exclusively by R2.
  - Acceptance: both orders of race rows 2, 5, 7, and 12; provider context grows only at the tail.
- [ ] **H4 — deferred writes, persisted configuration, and adjustments.** Dependencies: H3.
  - Add deferred lane-view tree/configuration writes, direct idle writes, model/thinking/active-tool persistence and lookup, `recordUsage`, pending-write snapshots/events, and finish conditionals.
  - Acceptance: both orders of race rows 3 and 9; accepted writes survive crashes and abort markers; adjustments affect ledger totals but never entries.
- [ ] **H5 — abort, wait, run-when-idle, and close.** Dependencies: H4.
  - Add durable abort acceptance, queue draining, pending-write application, synthetic closure messages/results, suspended abort, idle waiters/callbacks, and process-local close settlement.
  - Acceptance: both orders of race rows 4, 6, 8, and 10 and crash/reopen after every abort action.
- [ ] **H6 — live durable tool batches.** Dependencies: H5.
  - Wire section 14 tool callbacks through `Effects`; write `tool_started` before execution, persist finalized results and `terminate`, report usage, and emit tool events.
  - Acceptance: exact one-tool and parallel-batch traces; no blocked/invalid tool writes an intent; source-order finalization is stable.
- [ ] **H7 — tool recovery.** Dependencies: H6.
  - Consume R2's X1–X5 reduced state and reconcile it; replay only when persisted and current declarations are safe, preserve ordinals, and handle truncated batches without execution. Do not duplicate reducer logic.
  - Acceptance: complete tool crash matrix, changed replay declarations, parallel-prefix crashes, and idempotent second recovery.
- [ ] **H8 — deferred provider redemption.** Dependencies: H7.
  - Integrate the already-landed pi-ai deferred APIs: suspend, pending re-park, ready continuation, terminal/rejected fetch failure, handle mismatch, and best-effort cancellation.
  - Select and document whether `resume()` uses a non-zero `fetchDeferred` wait or checks once and re-parks immediately.
  - Acceptance: one fetch per resume; pending writes nothing except reported usage; terminal errors never start replacement requests.

### Track C/N — structural operations

These packages also own `agent-harness.ts` and merge after H8, in order C1 → C2 → C3 → N1.

- [ ] **C1 — manual compaction operation.** Dependencies: H8.
  - Add acceptance, hook decision, durable summary attempts/usage, complete `retainedTail`, result entry, abort/failure, and structural resume.
  - Acceptance: exact manual-compaction traces and every crash boundary; hook-supplied summaries obey the same persisted entry contract.
- [ ] **C2 — threshold auto-compaction.** Dependencies: C1, H4.
  - Run compaction inside the active run at checkpoints without a nested operation and continue the assistant loop.
  - Acceptance: append-only context holds except at the compaction boundary; repeated compaction retains the previous checkpoint tail.
- [ ] **C3 — overflow recovery.** Dependencies: C2, H2.
  - Classify recoverable overflow/length results, discard them after usage accounting, compact, retry once per conversational input, and fail boundedly.
  - Acceptance: every provider shape and crash row from sections 6 and 20, including hook decline and `length → length`.
- [ ] **N1 — move-first navigation.** Dependencies: C3.
  - Add acceptance, abandoned-branch preparation, hook/generated summary, move commit, post-move summary/fact writes, abort/failure, and structural resume.
  - Acceptance: every navigation crash row, including regeneration after a post-move crash and target/source validation.

### Track O — observability and core completion

These packages merge O1 → O2 → O3 → O4 after N1, with QA3 between O2 and O3. QA3 also requires J5. They may not modify `packages/coding-agent/**`.

- [ ] **O1 — snapshots and event completeness.** Dependencies: N1, I2.
  - Finish live lane/session snapshots, event filtering, streaming/running-tool state, and all section 10 event insertion points.
  - Acceptance: event nesting/order tests and attach-mid-operation snapshot tests with no subscription gap.
- [ ] **O2 — runtime telemetry instrumentation.** Dependencies: O1, I0.
  - Insert operation/checkpoint/turn/step wrappers at their procedure scopes, effect and passive-handler spans at their owning boundaries with `startHarnessSpan()`, and logical model-request spans with `startAiSpan()`. Populate only schema-declared attributes, including parallel tool children and resumed operation correlation; expected in-band failures set error status explicitly.
  - Acceptance: captured telemetry has exact schema-conforming span trees for success, failure, suspend/resume, retry, compaction, and parallel tools; every emitted start/end/event bag conforms independently, callback spans settle exactly once, and no undeclared names, content, or secrets appear in defaults.
- [ ] **O3 — action-prefix and race audit.** Dependencies: O2, QA3.
  - Complete Tier C for every race row, mechanically reopen every action prefix, compare automatic/manual logs, and verify reducer/live-state fixed points.
  - Acceptance: every race row has both orders and no documented crash action lacks a reopen test.
- [ ] **O4 — backend parity and final core audit.** Dependencies: J5, O3.
  - Run the complete storage/recovery matrix across memory, JSONL, and SQLite; remove dead agent/storage declarations and compatibility comments; verify exports/declarations and `./node`; update changelogs and core documentation.
  - Acceptance: all non-e2e tests and `npm run check` pass, no active harness operation remains scaffolded, `packages/coding-agent/**` is unchanged, and the worktree is clean.

### Dependency, priority, and merge summary

The serial storage lane is **R0 → J0 → J1 → J2 → J3 → J4 → J5**. The reducer lane is **R0 → R1 → R2 → R3**. The loop lane is **I0 → L1 → L2 → L3**. The effects lane is **R2 → I3 → I4 → I5**, with I4 also requiring I0, I1, and L3. Before H0, the convergence gate is **F0 + R3 + I2 + I5**.

The runtime merge lane is strictly **H0 → H1 → H2 → H3 → H4 → H5 → H6 → H7 → H8 → C1 → C2 → C3 → N1 → O1 → O2 → QA3 → O3 → O4**. J5 may land independently at any time before QA3. This ordering prevents concurrent rewrites of `agent-harness.ts`, assigns every public method, and ensures every live path lands only after its reducer, telemetry, interception, and effect boundaries exist.
